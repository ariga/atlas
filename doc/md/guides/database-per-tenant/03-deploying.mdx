In the previous section, we learned how to define target groups in Atlas to manage migrations for a database-per-tenant
architecture. In this section, we will see how to deploy migrations to the target groups.

## Setting up

For the purpose of this guide, we will use a simple example to demonstrate how to deploy migrations to
target groups. To simplify things, we will be using SQLite files as our target databases and statically
defining the target groups in the `atlas.hcl` file.

### Our project file

In our project directory, let's create a file named `atlas.hcl` with the following content:

```hcl
locals {
  tenant = ["tenant_1", "tenant_2"]
}

env "prod" {
  for_each = toset(local.tenant)
  url = "sqlite://${each.value}.db"
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
}
```

### An initial migration

Let's create an initial migration file to bootstrap our project:

```bash
atlas migrate new --edit init
```

Once the local editor opens, add the following SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

Save the file and exit the editor.  Observe that two new files were created in the `migrations/` directory:

```
├── 20240721101205_init.sql
└── atlas.sum

1 directory, 2 files
```

## Deploying the migrations

We can deploy the migrations directly to the target group using the `migrate apply` command with the `--env` flag:

```bash
atlas migrate apply --env prod
```

This command will apply the migrations to both `tenant_1` and `tenant_2` databases. Atlas will output:

```
Migrating to version 20240721101205 (1 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 20240721101205
    -> CREATE TABLE users (
         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT NOT NULL
       );
  -- ok (345.458µs)

  -------------------------
  -- 3.400333ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 sql statement
Migrating to version 20240721101205 (1 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 20240721101205
    -> CREATE TABLE users (
         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT NOT NULL
       );
  -- ok (266.375µs)

  -------------------------
  -- 905.875µs
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 sql statement
```

As you can see from the output, the migration was applied to both databases. Observe that two new files were created
in our project directory: `tenant_1.db` and `tenant_2.db`.

### Verifying our migrations were applied

We can check the current schema of our local SQLite databases using the `migrate status` command. Run:

```
atlas migrate status --url sqlite://tenant_1.db
```

Atlas prints:

```bash
Migration Status: OK
  -- Current Version: 20240721101205
  -- Next Version:    Already at latest version
  -- Executed Files:  1
  -- Pending Files:   0
```

As expected, the `tenant_1` database is up-to-date with the latest migration.

### Checking for Drift

Additionally, we may want to verify that the schema of the tenant database is in sync with the latest migration. We can
utilize the `schema diff` command to compare the current schema with the latest migration:

```bash
atlas schema diff \
  --dev-url 'sqlite://?mode=memory' \
  --from file://migrations \
  --to sqlite://tenant_1.db \
  --exclude 'atlas_schema_revisions'
```

Atlas will output:

```bash
Schemas are synced, no changes to be made.
```

## Next steps

As you can see, deploying migrations to target groups is straightforward using the Atlas CLI, but getting visibility
into the status of each tenant, is done individually. To bridge this gap, we will show how to use the Atlas Cloud
control plane to gain visibility into the status of our system in the next section.
