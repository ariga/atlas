title: Defining Target Groups
id: target-groups

In Atlas, a target group is a collection of target databases whose schema is managed together. In a database-per-tenant
architecture, each tenant's database is a target database, and all tenant databases are grouped into a target group.
However, you can also group databases by other criteria, such as environment (dev, staging, prod), region, or any other
criteria that makes sense for your application.

For example, you might group all databases in the same region into a target group to ensure that schema changes are
applied consistently across all databases in that region, or to group free-tier databases separately from
paid-tier databases.

Target groups can be defined statically or to be dynamically loaded from an API endpoint or a database query.

Target groups are defined in the project's `atlas.hcl` file and are later used by the Atlas CLI during the deployment
process to determine which databases to deploy to.

Let's review some examples of how to define target groups in Atlas.

## `env` blocks and `for_each` meta-arguments

Before we jump into various techniques to define target groups, let's first understand the `for_each` meta-argument for
environment blocks in Atlas.

Environment blocks (`env` blocks) are used in Atlas project files (`atlas.hcl`) to group configuration settings for
a specific environment. Normally, an `env` block is used to define the URL of a single target database, like so:

```hcl
env "dev" {
  url = "postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432/dev"
}
```

However, using the `for_each` meta-argument, it is possible to define multiple instances of a specific environment block
by iterating over a list of values. For example:

```hcl
locals {
  target_db_urls = [
    "postgres://root:pass@host-1:5432",
    "postgres://root:pass@host-2:5432",
  ]
}

env "targets" {
    for_each = toset(local.target_db_urls)
    url = each.value
}
```

When the `for_each` meta-argument is used, the `env` block is instantiated for each value in the list, and the `each`
object is used to access the current value. In our case, we will get two instances of the `target` block, one for each
URL in the `target_db_urls` list.

## Dynamically Compiling URLs

A technique commonly used in `atlas.hcl` files is to dynamically compile URLs by combining values from various sources.
For instance, the database instance URL might be provided as an input variable, with the database name added to it
dynamically. Here's an example:

```hcl
variable "db_instance_url" {
  type = string
}

locals {
  tenants = ["acme_corp", "widget_inc", "wayne_enterprises", "stark_industries"]
}

env "tenants" {
  for_each = toset(local.tenants)
  url = urlsetpath(var.db_instance_url, each.value)
}
```

Let's review the code snippet above:
* We define a variable `db_instance_url` that will be used as the base URL for the database instances.
  This variable is provided by the user when running the Atlas CLI by providing the `--var` flag.
* We define a local variable `tenants` that contains a list of tenant names.
* We define an `env` block named `tenants` that iterates over the `tenants` list. For each tenant, we set the `url`
  attribute to the result of the `urlsetpath` function, which combines the `db_instance_url` with the tenant name.

:::info The `urlsetpath` function

The `urlsetpath` function is a helper function provided by Atlas that allows you to set the "path" part
of a URL. For example:

```hcl
urlsetpath("postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432", "mydb")
#  ↳ Evaluates to "postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"

urlsetpath("mysql://localhost:3306", "mydb") # Evaluates to "mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
#  ↳ Evaluates to "postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

## Loading data from local JSON files

Suppose our list of tenants is stored in a local file named `tenants.json`:

```json title="tenants.json"
{
  "tenants": [
    "acme_corp",
    "widget_inc",
    "wayne_enterprises",
    "stark_industries"
  ]
}
```

We can load this data into our `atlas.hcl` file using the `file` and `jsondecode` functions:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
locals {
  f = file("tenants.json")
  decoded = jsondecode(local.f)
  tenants = local.decoded.tenants
}

env "tenants" {
  for_each = toset(local.tenants)
  url = urlsetpath("postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432", each.value)
}
```

Next, we define an environment block for this target groups that consumes the `target_tenants` local variable
into the `for_each` argument:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "tenants" {
  for_each = toset(local.target_tenants)
  url = urlsetpath("postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432", each.value)
}
```

Let's review the code snippet above:
* We define a local variable `f` that reads the contents of the `tenants.json` file.
* Next, we use the `jsondecode` function to parse the JSON content into a structured object.
* We extract the `tenants` array from the decoded JSON object and store it in the `tenants` local variable.
* Finally, we define an `env` block named `tenants` that iterates over the `tenants` list. For each tenant, we set the `url`
  attribute to the result of the `urlsetpath` function, which combines the base URL with the tenant name.

## Incorporating Sensitive Data

Essentially, defining target groups in Atlas is about dynamically compiling a list of URLs that represent the target
databases. Database URLs often contain sensitive information, such as passwords, that should not be hardcoded in the
`atlas.hcl` file, which is typically checked into version control.

To address this issue, Atlas provides mechanisms for loading credentials from external sources, such as environment
variables or secret management systems. This allows you to keep your database credentials secure while still being able
to define target groups dynamically. Learn more about [Working with Secrets](/guides/deploying/secrets).

For the purpose of this example, suppose our database password is stored in an AWS Secrets Manager, created
using the AWS CLI as follows:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name db-pass-demo \
  --secret-string "p455w0rd"
```

The AWS CLI returns:

```json
{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:1111111111:secret:db-pass-demo-aBiM5k",
    "Name": "db-pass-demo",
    "VersionId": "b702431d-174f-4a8f-aee5-b80e687b8bf1"
}
```

To retrieve the secret value we will use the `runtimevar` data source in the `atlas.hcl` file:

```hcl
var "db_instance_url" {
  type = string
}

var "db_user" {
  type = string
}

data "runtimevar" "pass" {
  url = "awssecretsmanager://db-pass-demo?region=us-east-1"
}

locals {
  db_with_pass = urluserinfo(var.db_instance_url, var.db_user, data.runtimevar.pass.value)
  tenants = ["acme_corp", "widget_inc", "wayne_enterprises", "stark_industries"]
}

env "tenants" {
  for_each = toset(local.tenants)
  url = urlsetpath(local.db_with_pass, each.value)
}
```

Let's review what's going on here:
* We define two variables, `db_instance_url` and `db_user`, which are used to construct the database URL.
* We use the `runtimevar` data source to fetch the password from AWS Secrets Manager.
* We define a local variable `db_with_pass` that combines the database URL, the username, and the password.
* We define an `env` block named `tenants` that iterates over the `tenants` list. For each tenant, we set the `url`
  attribute to the result of the `urlsetpath` function, which combines the `db_with_pass` with the tenant name.

:::info The `urluserinfo` function

The `urluserinfo` function is a helper function provided by Atlas that allows you to set the "userinfo" part
of a URL. For example:

```hcl
urluserinfo("postgres://localhost:5432", "root", "p455w0rd")
#  ↳ Evaluates to "postgres://root:p455w0rd@localhost:5432"
```

## Loading Data from an API Endpoint

In some cases, you may want to load target groups dynamically from an API endpoint. For example, you might have a
service `tenant-svc` that provides a list of tenant databases based on some criteria.  Let's suppose this service's
endpoints recieve the target group id in the path, such as `https://tenant-svc/api/target-group/{id}` and return a
simple JSON payload:

```json
{
  "databases": [
    "acme_corp",
    "widget_inc",
    "wayne_enterprises",
    "stark_industries"
  ]
}
```

You can use the `runtimevar` data source to fetch with the `http` scheme to fetch this data and use it to define
target groups.

Here's an example of how you might load tenant databases from an API endpoint:

```hcl
var "group_id" {
    type = string
}

data "runtimevar" "tenants" {
  url = "http://tenant-svc/api/target-group/${var.group_id}"
}

locals {
  decoded = jsondecode(data.runtimevar.tenants)
  tenants = local.decoded.databases
}

env "tenants" {
  for_each = toset(local.tenants)
  url = urlsetpath("postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432", each.value)
}
```

Let's unpack this example:
* We define a variable `group_id` that will be used to fetch the tenant databases from the API endpoint.
* We use the `runtimevar` data source with the `http` scheme to fetch the tenant databases from the API endpoint.
* We parse the JSON response using the `jsondecode` function and extract the `databases` array.
* We define an `env` block named `tenants` that iterates over the `tenants` list. For each tenant, we set the `url`
  attribute to the result of the `urlsetpath` function, which combines the base URL with the tenant name.

By using the `runtimevar` data source with the `http` scheme, you can dynamically load target groups from an API
endpoint and use them to define target groups in your Atlas project.

## Loading data from a Database Query

In some cases, you may want to load target groups dynamically from a database query. For example, you might have a
database schema for each tenant in some instance, and would like to retrieve the list from the database's native
`information_schema` tables.

You can utilize the `sql` data source to fetch this data and use it to define target groups.
