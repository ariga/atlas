[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), one of the prominent columnar databases, is designed for real-time analytics,
providing exceptional speed and efficiency in handling large datasets.

Many teams adopt ClickHouse for its speed and cost-efficiency only to discover that the day 2 operations of managing its
schema can be a puzzle. Sure, if your schema contains a handful of tables that rarely change,
youâ€™re probably not going to feel much of this pain. But for mission-critical applications, managing complex and interconnected
schemas while moving fast without breaking things becomes difficult.

#### Enter: Atlas

Atlas helps developers manage their database schema as code - abstracting away the intricacies of database schema
management. With Atlas, users provide the desired state of the database schema and Atlas automatically plans the
required migrations.

In this guide, we will dive into setting up Atlas for ClickHouse, and introduce the different workflows available.

## Prerequisites

1. A ClickHouse database
2. Docker
3. Atlas installed on your machine:
<InstallationInstructions />

## Logging in to Atlas

To use ClickHouse with Atlas, you'll need to [log in to Atlas](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup). If it's your first time,
you will be prompted to create both an account and a workspace (organization):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="web" label="Via Web">

```shell
atlas login
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="token" label="Via Token">

```shell
atlas login --token "ATLAS_TOKEN"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="env-var" label="Via Environment Variable">

```shell
ATLAS_TOKEN="ATLAS_TOKEN" atlas login
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Inspecting our Database

Let's start off by spinning up a database using Docker:

```shell
docker run --rm -d --name atlas-demo -e CLICKHOUSE_DB=demo -p 9000:9000 clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest
```

For this example we will begin with a minimal database with a `users` table and an `id` as the primary key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` UInt64,
  `name` String NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY id;
```

To create the table above on our local database, we can run the following command:

```sql
 docker exec -it atlas-demo clickhouse-client --query 'CREATE TABLE demo.users (id UInt64, name String NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY id'
```

The `atlas schema inspect` command supports reading the database description provided by a [URL](/concepts/url) and outputting it in
different formats, including [Atlas DDL](/atlas-schema/hcl.mdx) (default), SQL, and JSON. In this guide, we will
demonstrate the flow using both the Atlas DDL and SQL formats, as the JSON format is often used for processing the
output using `jq`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

To inspect our locally-running ClickHouse instance, use the `-u` flag and write the output to a file named `schema.hcl`:

```shell
atlas schema inspect -u "clickhouse://localhost:9000/demo" > schema.hcl
```

Open the `schema.hcl` file to view the Atlas schema that describes our database.

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
table "users" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = UInt64
  }
  column "name" {
    null = false
    type = String
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
schema "demo" {
  engine  = sql("Memory")
}
```

This first block represents a [table](/atlas-schema/hcl.mdx#table) resource with `id`, and `name`
columns. The `schema` field references the `demo` schema that is defined in the block below. In addition, the `primary_key`
sub-block defines the `id` column as the primary key for the table. Atlas strives to mimic the syntax of the database
that the user is working against. In this case, the type for the `id` column is `UInt64`, and `String` for the `name` column.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

To inspect our locally-running ClickHouse instance, use the `-u` flag and write the output to a file named `schema.sql`:

```shell
atlas schema inspect -u "clickhouse://localhost:9000/demo" --format '{{ sql . }}' > schema.sql
```

Open the `schema.sql` file to view the inspected SQL schema that describes our database.

```sql title="schema.sql"
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` UInt64,
    `name` String)
 ENGINE = MergeTree
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
For in-depth details on the `atlas schema inspect` command, covering aspects like inspecting specific schemas,
handling multiple schemas concurrently, excluding tables, and more, refer to our documentation
[here](/declarative/inspect).
:::

To generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), or a visual representation of our schema, we can add the `-w` flag
to the inspect command:

```shell
atlas schema inspect -u "clickhouse://localhost:9000/example" -w
```

![clickhouse-inspect](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/clickhouse/images/clickhouse-inspect.png)

## Declarative Migrations

The declarative approach allows users to manage their database schemas by simply defining the desired end schema, and
Atlas provides a safe way to alter the database to get there. Let's see this in action.

We will start off by making a change to our schema file, such as adding a `repos` table:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

```hcl title=schema.hcl
table "users" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = UInt64
  }
  column "name" {
    null = false
    type = String
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}

// highlight-start
table "repos" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    type = UInt64
    null = false
  }
  column "name" {
    type = String
    null = false
  }
  column "owner_id" {
    type = Bigint
    null = false
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
schema "demo" {
  engine  = sql("Memory")
}
// highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql title="schema.sql"
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` UInt64,
    `name` String)
 ENGINE = MergeTree
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

// highlight-start
-- Create "repos" table
CREATE TABLE `repos` (
    `id` UInt64,
    `name` String,
    `owner_id` Int64)
 ENGINE = MergeTree
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
 //highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that our _desired state_ has changed, to apply these changes to our database, Atlas will plan a migration for us
by running the `atlas schema apply` command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

```shell
atlas schema apply \
-u "clickhouse://localhost:9000/demo" \
--to file://schema.hcl \
--dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/demo"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```shell
atlas schema apply \
-u "clickhouse://localhost:9000/demo" \
--to file://schema.sql \
--dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/demo"
```
  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Apply the changes, and that's it! You have successfully run a declarative migration.

:::info
For a more detailed description of the `atlas schema apply` command refer to our documentation
[here](/declarative/apply).
:::

To ensure that the changes have been made to the schema, let's run the `inspect` command with the `-w` flag once more
and view the ERD:

![atlas-schema](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/clickhouse/images/clickhouse-two-tables.png)

## Versioned Migrations

Alternatively, the versioned migration workflow, sometimes called "change-based migrations", allows each change to the
database schema to be checked-in to source control and reviewed during code-review. Users can still benefit from Atlas
intelligently planning migrations for them, however they are not automatically applied.

### Creating the first migration

In the versioned migration workflow, our database state is managed by a _migration directory_. The migration directory
holds all of the migration files created by Atlas, and the sum of all files in lexicographical order represents the current
state of the database.

To create our first migration file, we will run the `atlas migrate diff` command, and we will provide the necessary parameters:

* `--dir` the URL to the migration directory, by default it is file://migrations.
* `--to` the URL of the desired state. A state can be specified using a database URL, HCL or SQL schema, or another migration directory.
* `--dev-url` a URL to a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) that will be used to compute the diff.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

```shell
atlas migrate diff initial \
  --to file://schema.hcl \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```shell
atlas migrate diff initial \
  --to file://schema.sql \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Run `ls migrations`, and you'll notice that Atlas has automatically created a migration directory for us, as well as
two files:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="file" label="20240130122951_initial.sql" default>

```sql
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` UInt64,
    `name` String)
 ENGINE = MergeTree
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
-- Create "repos" table
CREATE TABLE `repos` (
    `id` UInt64,
    `name` String,
    `owner_id` Int64)
 ENGINE = MergeTree
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="atlas.sum" label="atlas.sum">

```shell
h1:NrYfakYn4W3xiS9VqcP98sqvgLUPn9pJpxFndh1GWsQ=
20240130122951.sql h1:R+eBw2nOk2+VLBvJ/dn49OphxzfxoWEBUxAy4Zp3VAE=
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The migration file represents the current state of our database, and the sum file is used by Atlas to maintain the integrity
of the migration directory. To learn more about the sum file, read the [documentation](/concepts/migration-directory-integrity).

### Pushing migration directories to Atlas

Now that we have our first migration, we can apply it to a database. There are multiple ways to accomplish this, with
most methods covered in the [guides](/guides) section. In this example, we'll demonstrate how to push migrations to
[Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud), much like how Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src="https://atlasgo.io/uploads/clickhouse/images/first-push.png" alt="clickhouse migrate push" width="100%"/>
    <p style={{fontSize: 12}}>Migration Directory created with <code>atlas migrate push</code></p>
</div>

Let's name our new migration project `app` and run `atlas migrate push`:

```shell
atlas migrate push app \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11"
```

Once the migration directory is pushed, Atlas prints a URL to the created directory, similar to the once shown in the
image above.

### Applying migrations

Once our `app` migration directory has been pushed, we can apply it to a database from any CD platform without
necessarily having our directory there.

We'll create a simple Atlas configuration file (`atlas.hcl`) to store the settings for our local environment:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {1}
# The "dev" environment represents our local testings.
env "local" {
  url = "clickhouse://localhost:9000/example"
  migration {
    dir = "atlas://app"
  }
}
```

The final step is to apply the migrations to the database. Let's run `atlas migrate apply` with the `--env` flag
to instruct Atlas to select the environment configuration from the `atlas.hcl` file:

```shell
atlas migrate apply --env local
```

Boom! After applying the migration, you should receive a link to the deployment and the database where the migration
was applied. Here's an example of what it should look like:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src="https://atlasgo.io/uploads/clickhouse/images/clickhouse-deployment.png" alt="first deployment" width="100%"/>
    <p style={{fontSize: 12}}>Migration deployment reported created with <code>atlas migrate apply</code></p>
</div>

### Generating another migration

After applying the first migration, it's time to update our schema defined in the schema file and tell Atlas to generate
another migration. This will bring the migration directory (and the database) in line with the new state defined by the
desired schema (schema file).

Let's make two changes to our schema:

* Add a new `description` column to our repos table
* Add a new `commits` table

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
table "users" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = UInt64
  }
  column "name" {
    null = false
    type = String
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
table "repos" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    type = UInt64
    null = false
  }
  column "name" {
    type = String
    null = false
  }
// highlight-start
  column "description" {
    type = sql("Nullable(String)")
    null = true
  }
// highlight-end
  column "owner_id" {
    type = Bigint
    null = false
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
// highlight-start
table "commits" {
  schema = schema.demo
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    type = UInt64
    null = false
  }
  column "message" {
    type = String
    null = false
  }
  column "repo_id" {
    type = Bigint
    null = false
  }
  column "author_id" {
    type = Bigint
    null = false
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
// highlight-end
schema "demo" {
  engine  = sql("Memory")
}

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql title = "schema.sql"
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` UInt64,
  `name` String NOT NULL
)  ENGINE = MergeTree
   PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
   SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

CREATE TABLE `repos` (
  `id` UInt64,
  `name` String NOT NULL,
// highlight-next-line
  `description` String NULL,
  `owner_id` Bigint NOT NULL
) ENGINE = MergeTree
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
  SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;;

// highlight-start
CREATE TABLE `commits` (
  `id` UInt64,
  `message` String NOT NULL,
  `repo_id` Bigint NOT NULL,
  `author_id` Bigint NOT NULL,
)  ENGINE = MergeTree
   PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
   SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;;
// highlight-end
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, let's run the `atlas migrate diff` command once more:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="hcl" label="Atlas DDL (HCL)" default>

```shell
atlas migrate diff add_commits \
  --to file://schema.hcl \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```shell
atlas migrate diff add_commits \
  --to file://schema.sql \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Run `ls migrations`, and you'll notice that a new migration has been generated.

```sql title="20240130141055.sql"
ALTER TABLE `repos` ADD COLUMN `description` Nullable(String);
-- Create "commits" table
CREATE TABLE `commits` (
   `id` UInt64,
   `message` String,
   `repo_id` Int64,
   `author_id` Int64
) ENGINE = MergeTree
PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

Let's run `atlas migrate push` again and
observe the new file on the migration directory page.

```shell
atlas migrate push app \
  --dev-url "docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev"
```

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img src="https://atlasgo.io/uploads/clickhouse/images/second-push.png" alt="clickhouse migrate push" width="100%"/>
    <p style={{fontSize: 12}}>Migration Directory created with <code>atlas migrate push</code></p>
</div>
