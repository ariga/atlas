In PostgreSQL, a [composite type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rowtypes.html) is structured like a row or record, consisting of field names and their corresponding
data types. Setting a Sequelize model as a composite type enables you to store complex and structured data in a single column.

This guide explains how to define a model type as a composite type in your Sequelize models and configure the schema migration
to manage both the composite types and the Sequelize models as a single migration unit using Atlas.

:::info [Atlas Pro Feature](/features#pro-plan)
Atlas support for [Composite Types](/atlas-schema/hcl#composite-type) is available exclusively to Pro users.
To use this feature, run:
```
atlas login
```

## Getting started with Atlas and Sequelize
Before we continue to composite types, ensure you have installed the [Atlas Sequelize Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-sequelize)
on your Sequelize project.

To set up, follow along the [getting started guide](/guides/orms/sequelize) for Sequelize and Atlas.

## Composite Schema

The Sequelize models are mostly used for defining tables and interacting with the database. Composite types,
or any other database objects do not have representation in Sequelize models - a composite type can be defined once,
and may be used multiple times in different columns and models.

In order to extend our PostgreSQL schema to include both custom composite types and our Sequelize types, we configure Atlas to
read the state of the schema from a [Composite Schema](/atlas-schema/projects#data-source-composite_schema)
data source. Follow the steps below to configure this for your project:

1\. Create a `schema.sql` that defines the necessary composite type. In the same way, you can configure the composite type in
[Atlas Schema HCL language](/atlas-schema/hcl-types#composite-type):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value={"sql"} label={"Using SQL"}>

```sql title="schema.sql"
CREATE TYPE address AS (
  street text,
  city   text
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={"hcl"} label={"Using HCL"}>

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
schema "public" {}

composite "address" {
  schema = schema.public
  field "street" {
    type = text
  }
  field "city" {
    type = text
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2\. In your Sequelize models, define a column that uses the composite type only in PostgreSQL dialect:

```javascript title="user.js"
'use strict';
module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) {
    const Address = {
        type: 'Address',
        fields: [
            'street',
            'city',
        ],
    };
    const User = sequelize.define('User', {
        name: {
            type: DataTypes.STRING,
            allowNull: false
        },
        address: Address
    });
    return User;
};
```

3\. In your [`atlas.hcl`](/guides/orms/sequelize#standalone-mode) config file, add a `composite_schema` that includes both your custom types defined in
`schema.sql` and your Sequelize models:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
data "composite_schema" "app" {
  # Load custom types first.
  schema "public" {
    url = "file://schema.sql"
  }
  schema "public" {
    url = data.external_schema.sequelize.url
  }
}

env "local" {
  src = data.composite_schema.app.url
  dev = "docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public"
}
```

## Usage

After setting up our schema, we can get its representation using the `atlas schema inspect` command, generate migrations for
it, apply them to a database, and more. Below are a few commands to get you started with Atlas:

#### Inspect the Schema

The `atlas schema inspect` command is commonly used to inspect databases. However, we can also use it to inspect our
`composite_schema` and print the SQL representation of it:

```shell
atlas schema inspect \
  --env local \
  --url env://src \
  --format '{{ sql . }}'
```

The command above prints the following SQL. Note, the `address` composite type is defined in the schema before
its usage in the `address` field:

```sql
-- Create composite type "address"
CREATE TYPE "address" AS ("street" text, "city" text);
-- Create "Users" table
CREATE TABLE "Users" ("id" serial NOT NULL, "name" character varying(255) NOT NULL, "address" "address" NULL, "createdAt" timestamptz NOT NULL, "updatedAt" timestamptz NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
```

#### Generate Migrations For the Schema

To generate a migration for the schema, run the following command:

```shell
atlas migrate diff \
  --env local
```

Note that a new migration file is created with the following content:

```sql title="migrations/20240712090543.sql"
-- Create composite type "address"
CREATE TYPE "address" AS ("street" text, "city" text);
-- Create "Users" table
CREATE TABLE "Users" ("id" serial NOT NULL, "name" character varying(255) NOT NULL, "address" "address" NULL, "createdAt" timestamptz NOT NULL, "updatedAt" timestamptz NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
```

#### Apply the Migrations

To apply the migration generated above to a database, run the following command:

```
atlas migrate apply \
  --env local \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/database?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```

:::info Apply the Schema Directly on the Database

Sometimes, there is a need to apply the schema directly to the database without generating a migration file. For example,
when experimenting with schema changes, spinning up a database for testing, etc. In such cases, you can use the command
below to apply the schema directly to the database:

```shell
atlas schema apply \
  --env local \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/database?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```
