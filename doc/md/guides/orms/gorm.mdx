[GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html), a popular ORM in the Go community, provides basic schema migration capabilities using its `AutoMigrate` feature,
suitable mostly for local development and small projects. For more advanced schema control, Atlas automates the process by comparing and
managing database states, integrating seamlessly with GORM projects.

### Loading GORM Models Into Atlas

<span>
To use Atlas with GORM, there are two modes in which the Atlas GORM Provider can load your schema.
Choose the one that suits your project setup.

### Managing Database Objects

Like many ORMs, GORM provides a way to define the most common database objects, such as tables, columns, and indexes
using Go structs and tags. Atlas extends this capability by allowing you to define more advanced database objects
such as composite types, domain types, and triggers.
