Visualizing a database schema using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool is helpful in providing a clear and intuitive
representation of the database structure, making it easier to understand the relationships and dependencies between different
entities.

With Atlas, you can easily visualize your GORM schema.

## Getting started with Atlas and GORM

Before we continue, ensure you have installed the [Atlas GORM Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm)
on your GORM project.

To set up, follow along the [getting started guide](/guides/orms/gorm) for GORM and Atlas.

## Project Setup

### GORM Schema

Assume we have the following GORM `models.go` file:

```go title="models.go"
package models

import (
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

type User struct {
	gorm.Model
	Username  string `gorm:"uniqueIndex;not null"`
	Email     string `gorm:"uniqueIndex;not null"`
	Posts 	  []Post
	Comments  []Comment
}

type Post struct {
	gorm.Model
	Title    string `gorm:"not null"`
	Content  string `gorm:"type:text;not null"`
	UserID   uint
	Comments []Comment
}

type Comment struct {
	gorm.Model
	Content string `gorm:"type:text;not null"`
	UserID  uint
	PostID  uint
}
```

Above we see three types: `User`, `Post` and `Comment`. The `User` model includes fields for `username` and `email`.
The `Post` model contains fields for `title` and `content`, referencing the user who created it and allowing for multiple comments.
The `Comment` model includes the content of the comment and references both the user and the post.

### Config File

Before we begin testing, create a [config file](/atlas-schema/projects#project-files) named
`atlas.hcl`.

In this file we will create an environment, specify the source of our schema,
and a URL for our [dev database](/concepts/dev-database).

:::note
Be sure to update the `--path` in the config file with the correct path, as well as `--dialect` and `dev`
depending on which database you are using.
:::

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
data "external_schema" "gorm" {
  program = [
  "go",
  "run",
  "-mod=mod",
  "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm",
  "load",
// highlight-next-line
  "--path", "./path/to/models",
  "--dialect", "postgres", // | mysql | sqlite | sqlserver
  ]
}

env "gorm" {
  src = data.external_schema.gorm.url
  dev = "docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public"
}
```

## Visualizing

Now that we are all setup, we can visualize our GORM types by running the [`inspect`](/declarative/inspect) command
with the `-w` flag:

```bash
 atlas schema inspect --env gorm --url env://src -w
```

If you are not logged in, the output should be similar to:

```bash
? Where would you like to share your schema visualization?:
  â–¸ Publicly (gh.atlasgo.cloud)
  Your personal workspace (requires 'atlas login')
```

Our browser should open:

Amazing! Now you can easily view and share your schema. Logged in users can
also privately create schemas and save them for future use.
