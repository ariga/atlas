To use GORM with Atlas, we will use the [GORM Atlas Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm)
to automatically plan schema migrations.

### Installation

1. Install Atlas from macOS or Linux by running:

```shell
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```

See [atlasgo.io](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) for more installation options.

2. Install the provider by running:
```shell
go get -u ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm
```

### Setup
If your GORM models are spread across multiple packages, or **do not** embed `gorm.Model` or contain `gorm` struct tags,
you can use the provider as a library in your Go program to load your GORM schema into Atlas.

1. Create a new program named `loader/main.go` with the following contents:

```go title=main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "os"

    "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema"

    "github.com/<yourorg>/<yourrepo>/path/to/models"
)

func main() {
    stmts, err := gormschema.New("mysql").Load(&models.User{})
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "failed to load gorm schema: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    io.WriteString(os.Stdout, stmts)
}
```

:::info
Be sure to replace `github.com/<yourorg>/<yourrepo>/path/to/models` with the import path to your GORM models.
In addition, replace the model types (e.g `models.User`) with the types of your GORM models.
:::

2. In your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl title=atlas.hcl
data "external_schema" "gorm" {
  program = [
    "go",
    "run",
    "-mod=mod",
    "./loader",
  ]
}
env "gorm" {
  src = data.external_schema.gorm.url
  dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev"
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify Setup

Next, let's verify Atlas is able to read our desired schema, by running the
[`schema inspect`](/declarative/inspect) command, to inspect our desired schema (GORM models).

```shell
atlas schema inspect --env gorm --url "env://src"
```

Notice that this command uses `env://src` as the target URL for inspection, meaning "the schema represented by the
`src` attribute of the `local` environment block."

Given we have a simple GORM model `user` :

```go title="user.go"
type User struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name    string
    Age     int
}
```

We should get the following output after running the `inspect` command above:

```hcl
table "users" {
  schema = schema.dev
  column "id" {
    null           = false
    type           = bigint
    unsigned       = true
    auto_increment = true
  }
  column "created_at" {
    null = true
    type = datetime(3)
  }
  column "updated_at" {
    null = true
    type = datetime(3)
  }
  column "deleted_at" {
    null = true
    type = datetime(3)
  }
  column "name" {
    null = true
    type = longtext
  }
  column "age" {
    null = true
    type = bigint
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
  index "idx_users_deleted_at" {
    columns = [column.deleted_at]
  }
}
schema "dev" {
  charset = "utf8mb4"
  collate = "utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci"
}
```

### Next Steps

Now that your project is set up, start by choosing between the two workflows offered by Atlas for generating and
planning migrations.
Select the one you prefer that works best for you:

* **Declarative Migrations**: Set up a Terraform-like workflow where each migration is calculated as the diff between
your desired state and the current state of the database.

* **Versioned Migrations**: Set up a migration directory for your project, creating a version-controlled source of truth
of your database schema.
