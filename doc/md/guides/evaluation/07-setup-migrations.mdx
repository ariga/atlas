title: Setup Versioned Migrations
---

## Intro

Similarly to other migration tools, in its _Versioned Migrations flow_ Atlas keeps track of schema changes in a
_Migration Directory_.  This is a directory containing SQL migration scripts, which are named following this convention

```
<version>_<label>.sql
```
For example:

```
20240520182336_add_users_table.sql
```
The label is optional, so this filename is also valid:
```
20240520182336.sql
```
By default, Atlas generates migration files with the `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.sql` naming convention, where `YYYY` is the year,
`MM` is the month, `DD` is the day, `HH` is the hour, `MM` is the minute, and `SS` is the second when the file was created.
However, you may choose to name your files in another way, as long as versions are numeric and ordered lexicographically.

In this section, we generate the baseline migration directory for your project from your "schema-as-code".

## Step 1: Configuration

Let's further evolve our `atlas.hcl` configuration file to describe how versioned migrations should be handled.

By default, migrations will be stored in the `migrations` directory relative to the current working directory, however
it is good practice to explicitly define the location for your migration directory in the project configuration file.
Add the following line to your `local` env block:

```hcl {3-10}
env "local" {
  // .. redacted for brevity
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

The `format` block configures migrations to be created with indentation for improved readability.

## Step 2: Create the Baseline Migration

The next step is to create a baseline migration which contains our project schema up until this point.

To plan this initial migration run the following command:

```shell
atlas migrate diff --env local baseline
```

Observe two new files are created under the `migrations/` directory:

```
.
├── 20240604131146_baseline.sql
└── atlas.sum
```

The first file is the baseline migration, and the second, `atlas.sum`, is the migration directory
[integrity file](/concepts//migration-directory-integrity) which protects your project from conflicts
between developers working in parallel.

### How does this work?

Here's what Atlas does when you run `atlas migrate diff`:

1. It reads the desired schema as defined in the environment `src` attribute.
2. It replays all migrations on the Dev Database and takes a snapshot of the schema.
3. Atlas calculates a diff between the desired state (step 1) and the current state (step 2)
4. Atlas writes a new migration file to the `migrations/` directory and updates the `atlas.sum` file.

## Step 3: Verify the generated migration

To verify the migration was calculated correctly you can compare it to your live database:

```
atlas schema diff --env local --from "$DB_URL" --to file://migrations
```

If all went well, you should see a message similar to:

```
Schemas are synced, no changes to be made.
```
