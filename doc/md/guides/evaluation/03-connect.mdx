In this section we perform read-only operations and make no changes to your database.

With the Atlas CLI installed and logged-in to your account, let's now make sure we can connect to your database
with the CLI.

## Step 1: Determine the database's URL

Atlas uses a standard URL format to connect to databases and load schemas and migrations from various sources. The format
below covers the supported parts of a URL, with subsequent sections providing more detailed examples.

```
driver://[username[:password]@]address/[schema|database][?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]
```

Here are some popular examples you can use:

| Engine        |                                                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL    | `postgres://root:pass@localhost:5432/database?search_path=public`        |
| MySQL         | `mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/app_schema`                            |
| SQL Server    | `sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master&mode=schema` |
| ClickHouse    | `clickhouse://user:pass@localhost:9000/schema?secure=true`               |
| More examples | In the [URL Docs](/concepts/url)                                                   |

## Step 2: Choose connection scope

### Schema vs Database-scope

Most databases provide a way for users to namespace resources.  This feature is commonly named `schemas`.
For instance, PostgreSQL and MySQL users may create additional schemas in a target database using a command such as:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA auth;
```

Going forward, resources may be created under the `auth` schema, in a few ways:

1. By qualifying the resource name with the schema name, so the database knows which specific
  resource we are talking about, for example:
  ```sql
  create table `auth`.`session_log` (
      -- ...
  )
  ```
2. By using the `USE <schema>` statement before executing the relevant statement. For example:
  ```
  USE `auth`;
  create table `session_log` (
    -- ...
  )
  ```

### Which kind of scope should you use?

Depending on your use-case, you may require a schema or database scope connection. The following table summarizes
some of these cases.

| Use-case                                                 | Scope to use   |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| All of my tables are in one schema                       | Schema-scope   |
| I want to use qualified identifiers (e.g `auth`.`users`) | Database-scope |
| I want to use database `EXTENSIONS` (Postgres) [Why?](/atlas-schema/hcl#extension)          | Database-scope |
| I want to see the entire database                        | Database-scope |

### Scoped connections

By default, Atlas will create a database-scoped connection.  However, it is possible to limit the scope of
the connection by providing it within the connection URL. For example:

  | Engine        | Schema-scope                                          | Database-scope              |
  |---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | PostgreSQL    | `postgres://localhost:5432/database?search_path=public` | `postgres://:5432/database`   |
  | MySQL         | `mysql://localhost:3306/app_schema`                     | `mysql://localhost:3306/`     |
  | ClickHouse    | `clickhouse://localhost:9000/schema`                    | `clickhouse://localhost:9000` |
  | SQL Server    | `sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master&mode=schema` | `sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master&mode=database` |
  | More examples | In the [URL Docs](/concepts/url)                          |                             |

## Test your connection

Once you have determined your full connection URL including its scope, you can test that Atlas is able to
connect to the database using the following command:

```bash
atlas schema inspect --url "<url>" --format "OK"
```

Be sure to replace `<url>` with your database's URL.

If Atlas is able to connect to the given URL you should see the following output:

```
OK
```

### Troubleshooting

#### My password contains non-alphanumeric characters

Atlas uses standard [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) URLs, which means
that "userinfo" section (which contains user and password) needs to be "pct-encoded" - commonly referred to
as [URI encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent).

For example, `Pa$$w@rd` becomes `Pa%24%24w%40rd` and `a%b%c` becomes `a%25b%25c`.

In case your password contains non-alphanumeric characters (as is often required by system administrators who want to
increase minimal password complexity), you must encode your password before using it in your Atlas URL.

Suppose your database password is `BnB+PjA`, attempting to use this password without encoding it first will result in
an error message similar to:

```
Error: mysql: query system variables: dial tcp: lookup root:BnB+PjA:3309: no such host
```

To solve this, first encode your password using URL encoding. For example:

```python
import urllib.parse
pw = "BnB+PjA"
print(urllib.parse.quote(pw))
```
This program prints:
```
BnB%2BPjA
```

#### My connection times out

When you try to connect to your database using Atlas, you might encounter an error message similar to:

```
Error: postgres: scanning system variables: dial tcp 10.0.5.243:5432: connect: operation timed out
```

Or

```
Error: mysql: query system variables: dial tcp 10.0.5.243:5432: connect: operation timed out
```

These errors suggest that Atlas is attempting to connect to the database but is unable to establish
a network connection to the remote database at all.

To resolve this error, ensure that you can establish a network connection to the database from your
workstation. This might involve:

* Connecting to your company's VPN which has access to the database
* Connecting through a bastion server
* Changing firewall rules for the database to allow a connection from your machine.
