title: Verify Atlas understands your Schema
---

After successfully connecting to your database using Atlas,  our next step will be to verify that Atlas
is able to inspect your database schema and that it correctly normalizes it such that if re-applied to the
database no diff will be detected.

### Step 1: Export your database URL as an env var

To make the examples in this section brief, start by setting a local environment variable
containing the URL you determined for your database:

```
export DB_URL="<url>"
```

### Step 2: Store the schema in a local file

Use the Atlas `schema inspect` command to connect to your database, calculate its schema graph
and store it in a local file:

```
atlas schema inspect --url "$DB_URL" > schema.hcl
```

If everything worked correctly, you should find a file named `schema.hcl` in your current working
directory which contains the [Atlas DDL](/atlas-schema/hcl) representation of your schema.

### Step 3: Determine your Dev Database URL

To operate correctly, Atlas utilizes a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) to normalize and verify
schemas. Essentially, a dev-database is an *empty* database of the same type and version that you use
in production. When Atlas runs, it may run some operations against this database and is responsible
for cleaning up after and leaving the database in an empty state.

When working with Atlas, you can bring your own dev database, but most Atlas users prefer to use
Atlas's built-in `docker://` driver which will spin up a local, ephemeral Docker container and dispose
of it after for you.

As we mentioned in the [previous section](03-connect.mdx#schema-vs-database-scope), Atlas operates
differently if configured to use a database-scope vs a schema-scope. Be sure to use the same kind of
scope for your dev-database to avoid miscalculations and other trouble. The following table summarizes
some commonly used URLs.

| Engine     | Scope          | URL Example                                 |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| MySQL      | Schema-scope   | `docker://mysql/8/dev`                        |
|            | Database-scope | `docker://mysql/8`                            |
| PostgreSQL | Schema-scope   | `docker://postgres/16/dev?search_path=public` |
|            | Database-scope | `docker://postgres/16/dev`                    |
| ClickHouse | Schema-scope   | `docker://clickhouse/23.11/dev`               |
|            | Database-scope | `docker://clickhouse/23.11`                   |
| Others | | Find more examples in the [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) guide. |

### Step 4: Verify Zero Diff

Next, use Atlas's `schema diff` command to check that Atlas sees no difference between your inspected schema
as it is represented in the `schema.hcl` file and the actual database schema:

```shell
atlas schema diff --dev-url <dev db url> --from file://schema.hcl --to "$DB_URL"
```

Be sure to replace `<dev db url>` with the Dev Database URL you determined in step 3.

If everything works correctly, Atlas should print out a message similar to:

```
Schemas are synced, no changes to be made.
```

### Step 5 (Optional): Manual Verification

If your database schema contains resources with esoteric or uncommon database features, you may want to manually review
the inspected schema to make sure that it is inspected correctly.

If you prefer to review this in plain SQL DDL commands instead of the Atlas's HCL syntax, run the following command:

```shell
atlas schema inspect --url "$DB_URL" --format "{{ sql . }}"
```
