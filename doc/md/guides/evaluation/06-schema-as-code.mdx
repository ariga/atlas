title: Your Schema-as-Code

Atlas is built on the concept of "Database Schema-as-Code", where teams define the desired state of their database
as part of their code, and use an automated tool (such as Atlas) to plan, verify and apply schema changes (migrations)
automatically.

Naturally, the first part of setting up your project is to determine how your "schema as code" project is going to be
structured. Atlas provides a lot of flexibility around how to define this state as we will show below.

## Step 1: Choose your language

Atlas offers three main ways to define the desired state of your database schema:

1. [Atlas DDL](/atlas-schema/hcl) - is an HCL-based syntax (similar to Terraform) for defining database schemas.
For example:
```hcl
schema "default" {
}

table "users" {
  schema = schema.default
  column "name" {
    type = varchar(100)
  }
  // ... more
}
   ```
2. [Plain SQL](/atlas-schema/sql) - alternatively, you can use plain SQL DDL commands to define your database
schema. For example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    name varchar(100)
);
   ```
3. [ORMs](/guides#orms) - Atlas can extract the desired database schema from ORM data models, for example:
  ```python
  from django.db import models

  class User(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
  ```

### What should you choose?

As with any important engineering decision, there are pros and cons to every decision, which you should weigh against
your use case. Let's try to enumerate some benefits and potential issues with each alternative:

|                | SQL                                                                                                                  | Atlas DDL                                                                                              | ORM                                                                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Familiarity    | Teams likely already know how to define SQL tables.                                                                  | New syntax specific to Atlas, familiar to teams using Terraform.                                       | Developers are used to defining data models in their favorite framework's API.                |
| Order          | Schema order matters; foreign keys require careful planning or multiple statements.                                  | Resources can be defined in any order, providing flexibility.                                           | Models can be defined in different files; dependencies are resolved by the ORM engine.        |
| Editor Support | Imperative syntax limits IDE features like "Jump to Definition" and code completion.                                 | VSCode and JetBrains support with features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.               | Editor support varies; some frameworks offer type-safe APIs while others use string annotations.|

#### Familiarity
- **SQL:** Your team probably already knows how to define SQL tables, making SQL a familiar choice for many teams,
  leveraging existing knowledge and skills.
- **Atlas DDL:** The syntax is new and specific to Atlas but will feel familiar to teams used to working with Terraform,
  balancing the introduction of new concepts with leveraging Terraform's HCL familiarity.
- **ORM:** Your developers are already used to defining data models in their favorite framework's API, which can speed
  up development and reduce the learning curve for new team members.

#### Order

- **SQL:** Schemas must be replayable on a target database, meaning the order in which statements are written matters.
  For example, you cannot define a table that references another table via a foreign key before the dependent table is defined. This requires either disabling foreign key checks or splitting the table definition into a `CREATE` statement followed by an `ALTER` statement, complicating schema management and requiring careful planning.
- **Atlas DDL:** Atlas DDL is based on HCL, the same configuration language used by Terraform. Resources can be defined
  in any order, helping with logically splitting resources into different domains and offering more flexibility. This simplifies schema management and reduces dependencies between resources.
- **ORM:** This depends on the ORM specifics, but in general, ORM Models can be defined in different files where their
  dependencies are resolved by the ORM engine. This modularity simplifies development and maintenance of data models.

#### Editor Support
- **SQL:** Because SQL DDL is an imperative syntax, important IDE features (such as "Jump to Definition" and
  code completion) do not work great. This can hinder development efficiency and increase the potential for errors.
- **Atlas DDL:** Editor support for both VSCode and JetBrains includes syntax highlighting, auto-completion, syntax
  checking, jump to definition, multi-file support, and more. This comprehensive support enhances developer productivity and reduces the likelihood of errors.
- **ORM:** Editor support greatly varies. Some frameworks provide a 100% type-safe API which the editor understands,
  while others heavily rely on string-based annotations. Depending on the framework, developer efficiency and code
  robustness may vary.


### Must you choose only one?

In some cases, no alternative checks all the boxes and you need to find a way to build schemas that are
built from multiple building blocks. For example, you may want to use your favorite ORM to describe your schema
only to discover that it lacks support for some needed database functionality (e.g `VIEW` or `TRIGGER` resources).

In cases like these, we advise using the `composite_schema` data source which can be used to layer multiple schema
definitions one on top of the other. This way you can have your base models defined as _Django Models_, but additional
views and triggers layered on top in Atlas DDL.

See more on how to do this below.

## Step 2: Add your schema files

After you have determined what you would like to use as the desired state for your Database Schema-as-Code
setup with Atlas, let's add the relevant files to our project.

### Option A: Atlas DDL

Use the following command to inspect your target database schema to create an initial baseline for your project
with Atlas DDL:

```shell
atlas schema inspect --url "$DB_URL" --env local  > schema.sql
```

This command tells Atlas to connect to the database at `$DB_URL`, inspect it, use the
Dev Database defined in the `local` env.  By default, Atlas DDL is used as the output format.
We then redirect the output from Atlas into a new file, `schema.hcl` which we will use the the
source schema for our project.

Next, update your project configuration file, `atlas.hcl`, to add the `src` attribute which tells
Atlas it can find the desired state of the database in the given path:

```hcl
env "local" {
  //highlight-next-line
  src = "file://schema.hcl"
  dev = "docker://postgres/16/dev" // <-- Replace your with your dev database URL.
}
```

### Option B: Plain SQL

Use the following command to inspect your target database schema to create an initial baseline for your project
with plain SQL:

```shell
atlas schema inspect --url "$DB_URL" --env local --format "{{ sql . \" \"}}" > schema.sql
```

This command tells Atlas to connect to the database at `$DB_URL`, inspect it, use the
Dev Database defined in the `local` env and format it as plain SQL.  We then redirect the output
from Atlas into a new file, `schema.sql` which we will use the the source schema for our project.

Next, update your project configuration file, `atlas.hcl`, to add the `src` attribute which tells
Atlas it can find the desired state of the database in the given path:

```hcl
env "local" {
  //highlight-next-line
  src = "file://schema.sql"
  dev = "docker://postgres/16/dev" // <-- Replace your with your dev database URL.
}
```

### Option C: ORMs

ORMs require a bit more involvement in setting up our project, so refer to the relevant ORM guide:

#### Go

* [GORM](/guides/orms/gorm)
* [Ent](#)
* [Beego](/guides/orms/beego)

#### Python

* [SQLAlchemy](/guides/orms/sqlalchemy)
* [Django](/guides/orms/django)

#### Java

* [Hibernate](/guides/orms/hibernate)

#### Node.js

* [TypeORM](/guides/orms/typeorm)
* [Sequelize](/guides/orms/sequelize)

All of the examples above are a result of our team's work with our users and customers.

## Step 3: Verify our setup

Next, let's verify Atlas is able to read our desired schema, by introducing a new flag for
the `schema inspect` command, `--web`. After running a normal inspection of our database schema,
when provided with this flag, Atlas will offer to visualize our database schema in an online
ER Diagram on Atlas Cloud:

```shell
atlas schema inspect --env local --url "env://src" --web
```

Notice that this command uses `env://src` as the target URL for inspection, meaning "the schema represented by the
`src` attribute of the `local` environment block.

When you use the `--web` flag you can choose if you want to upload it a public link or privately
to your Atlas Cloud account:

```
? Where would you like to share your schema visualization?:
  ▸ Publicly (gh.atlasgo.cloud)
    Privately (your-account.atlasgo.cloud)
```

Public links can be shared with your colleagues without requiring them to have an Atlas Cloud account
while private links can only be accessed from within your account.

After choosing the option you prefer, if everything worked correctly you should see a diagram similar to
this:

:::info Alternative: Text-based Inspection

If you do not wish to visualize your schema on Atlas Cloud at this point, you can omit the `--web` option
to get a textual representation of your schema.
