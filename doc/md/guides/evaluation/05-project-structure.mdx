After successfully verifying Atlas can connect to your database and understand its schema, let's proceed
to setting up your project.


A typical project layout may look something similar to this:

```text
.
├── atlas.hcl
├── migrations
│   ├── 20240520182315.sql
│   ├── 20240520182336.sql
│   └── atlas.sum
└── schema.hcl
```

A typical Atlas project comprises 3 important parts:

* Schema-as-Code - The desired state of your database should be present "as code" in the source control repository of
  your project.
* Project Configuration File - this file is typically named `atlas.hcl` and is located in the root directory
  of your project. If you are using a "Monorepo" architecture, you will have one of these files per Atlas project.
* Migrations - While Atlas supports both purely [Versioned and Declarative](/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned) workflows, currently most teams
  that use Atlas in production use the mixed approach where the source of truth for the desired state of the schema
  is stored "as code", but migrations are still explicitly managed in a dedicated directory, typically named `migrations/`.

### Step 1: Create your project config file

Before moving on to building CI and deployment pipelines, we will focus on building a setup for local development.

Let's start this by creating our initial project configuration file.

Create a file named `atlas.hcl` and place it at your project root.

In this file define an `env` block for local development:

```hcl
env "local" {
  dev = "docker://postgres/16/dev" // <-- Replace your with your dev database URL.
}
```

Be sure to replace the `dev` URL with the URL you determined in [Step 3](verify-atlas#step-3-determine-your-dev-database-url)
of the previous section.

### Step 2: Verify your configuration works

Let's repeat our verification from the previous section, this time using the `--env` flag instead of spelling out
our Dev Database URL explicitly:

```shell
atlas schema diff --env local --from file://schema.hcl --to "$DB_URL"
```

This command will calculate the diff between the schema which we saved from your live database to `schema.hcl` in
a previous step and the current schema of the database in `$DB_URL`.

Unless your database schema changed in the interim, you should see the same output you got in the verification step
of the previous section:

```
Schemas are synced, no changes to be made.
```

In the next section, we will explore how to define the desired schema of your database, as code.
