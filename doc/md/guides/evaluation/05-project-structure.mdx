After successfully verifying Atlas can connect to your database and understand its schema, let's proceed
to setting up your project.


A typical project layout may look something similar to this:

```text
.
├── atlas.hcl
├── migrations
│   ├── 20240520182315.sql
│   ├── 20240520182336.sql
│   └── atlas.sum
└── schema.hcl
```

A typical Atlas project comprises 3 important parts:

* Desired State - Atlas's approach to database schema management is based on a concept we call "Database Schema-as-Code".
  The desired state of your database should be present "as code" in the source control repository of your project.
* Project Configuration File - this file is typically named `atlas.hcl` and is located in the root directory
  of your project. If you are using a "Monorepo" architecture, you will have one of these files per Atlas project.
* Migrations - While Atlas supports both purely [Versioned and Declarative](/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned) workflows, currently most teams
  that use Atlas in production use the mixed approach where the source of truth for the desired state of the schema
  is stored "as code", but migrations are still explicitly managed in a dedicated directory, typically named `migrations/`.
