## Introduction

This document describes in detail the detection of dropping foreign keys in MySQL databases, 
using Atlas's linting capabilities.

A foreign key constraint can be dropped from a table using the following command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE pets DROP FOREIGN KEY owner_id;
```

While this is sometimes desired, dropping a foreign key can have negative and sometimes unpredictable side effects which should be taken into consideration.
Atlas's [`migrate lint`](/versioned/lint) command can be used to detect when a foreign key is about to be dropped. For example:
```bash
atlas migrate lint --dir file://migrations --dev-url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/dev" --latest 1
```
If the file contains a foreign key drop, the output will be something like:

```bash
20230305125128.sql: constraint deletion detected:

	L1: Dropping foreign-key constraint "owner_id"
```


## Impact of dropping foreign key constraints

### Losing referential integrity
Foreign keys are the means by which a relational database maintains the [Referential Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) of the data it stores.  In short, this means that a database can enforce that all references that it contains are valid. 

For this reason, dropping a foreign key constraint should be done after considering the implication of no longer being able to guarantee referential integrity in the database.

Suppose our database schema contains a foreign key constraint between the `pets` and `users` tables:
<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}><a href="https://gh.atlasgo.cloud/explore/1b14810d"><img src="https://atlasgo.io/uploads/users-pets.png" alt="Pets ERD"/></a></p>

We can drop the foreign key between `pets` and `users` with the following command: 

```sql
ALTER TABLE pets DROP FOREIGN KEY owner_fk;
```

Now, inserting data into the `pets` table is still possible, however it is also possible to insert "invalid" data. For example, assuming the `users` table is empty, the following command will not fail:

```sql
INSERT INTO pets (name, owner_id) VALUES ('Fortuna', 1);
```

Losing referential integrity can result in an unexpected impact on a system. For example, a query containing a`JOIN` statement that was previously guaranteed to return a result, may not return one in some cases:
```sql
SELECT
    pets.name,
    users.name AS owner_name
FROM pets JOIN users ON pets.owner_id = users.id
WHERE pets.name = "spidey";
```
After dropping the constraint, any code that relied on the invariant that pets are always linked to an existing owner may suddenly begin to fail.

### Irreversible changes

It is also important to note that dropping a foreign key constraint is not always a reversible operation. Irreversible operations increase the risk of any change. This is because if something unexpected happens, it will not be possible to bring the system to its previous stable state. 

Continuing from our example above, if after dropping the foreign key constraint between the `pets` and `users` tables, we insert `pets` records that refer to a non-existing user, we will not be able to re-create the foreign key until these records are altered or deleted.

Following the previous example, trying to recreate the constraint will fail:
```sql
ALTER TABLE pets ADD CONSTRAINT owner_id FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES users (id);
// highlight-next-line-error-message
Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`pets`.`#sql-1_1140`, CONSTRAINT `owner_id` FOREIGN KEY (`owner_id`) REFERENCES `users` (`id`))
```


### Cascading
Cascading policies on foreign keys may be used for various reasons. For example, a cascading deletion policy can help save storage space by automatically cleaning irrelevant ("orphan") data. Another example: organizations are often legally obliged to delete all the data related to a deleted user. This is commonly achieved with deletion cascading policies.  
Dropping a foreign key constraint also cancels all cascading policies, and thus can cause unwanted behaviors as side effects of the constraint drop itself.

## Prevention

Preventing accidental constraint drops is easy with Atlas's [`migrate lint`](/versioned/lint)
command. With the `atlas migrate lint` command, users can analyze the migration directory to 
detect potentially dangerous changes to the database schema. This command may be 
incorporated in continuous integration pipelines to enable teams to enforce 
desired policies with regard to schema changes.

When using `migrate lint` to analyze migrations, users must supply multiple parameters:

* `--dev-url` - a URL to a [dev database](/concepts/dev-database) that will be used to simulate the changes and verify their correctness.
* `--dir` - the URL of the migration directory, by default it is file://migrations, e.g a directory named migrations in the current working directory.
