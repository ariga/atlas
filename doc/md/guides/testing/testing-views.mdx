Testing your database schema and migrations is crucial to ensure code behaves as expected, catch bugs early,
and prevent regressions. Databases enforce logic, constraints, and complex relationships,
so testing ensures these elements work correctly and remain intact after changes.

In this guide we will learn how to use Atlas's [`schema test`](/testing/schema) command to test database views.

## Database Views
A `view` is a virtual table in the database, defined by a statement that queries rows from one or more existing tables or views.

Views are currently available to logged-in users only. To use this feature, run:

## Project Setup

### Schema File
For this example, let's assume we have the following schema, including a view:

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
schema "public" {}

table "users" {
  schema = schema.public
  column "id" {
    type = int
  }
  column "name" {
    type = text
  }
  column "ssn" {
    type = varchar(9)
  }
}

// highlight-start
view "clean_users" {
  schema = schema.public
  column "id" {
    type = int
  }
  column "name" {
    type = text
  }
  as         = <<-SQL
  SELECT u.id, u.name
    FROM ${table.users.name} AS u
  SQL
  depends_on = [table.users]
  comment    = "A view to select active users without sensitive data"
// highlight-end
}
```

The schema has a simple `users` table, with `id`, `name`, and `ssn` as columns.
The view, `clean_users`, selects the `id` and `name` columns from `users`, ensuring we
aren't selecting any sensitive data (SSNs).

### Project File
Before we begin testing, create a [project file](/atlas-schema/projects#project-files) named
`atlas.hcl`.

In this file we will create an environment, specify the source of our schema,
and a URL for our [dev database](/concepts/dev-database).

We will also create a file named `schema.test.hcl` to write our tests, and
add it to the `atlas.hcl` file in the test block.

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "dev" {
  src = "file://schema.hcl"
  dev = "docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public"

  # Test configuration for local development.
  test {
    schema {
      src = ["schema.test.hcl"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Writing Tests

### Simple Test
Let's start off with a simple test that will do the following:
1. Seed data into the `users` table.
2. Run a query on the `clean_users` view.
3. Ensure the data is retrieved as expected.

```hcl title="schema.test.hcl"
test "schema" "view" {
  # Seeding to test view.
  exec {
    sql = "INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob'), (3, 'Charlie');"
  }
  log {
    message = "Seeded the user's table"
  }

  # Expected exec to pass.
  exec {
    sql = <<SQL
    SELECT id, name
    FROM clean_users;
    SQL
  }
  log {
    message = "Tested the view"
  }

  # Validates data.
  exec {
    sql = "SELECT id, name FROM clean_users;"
    format = table
    output = <<TAB
 id |  name
----+---------
 1  | Alice
 2  | Bob
 3  | Charlie
TAB
  }
  log {
    message = "Table is as expected"
  }
}

```

:::info

To run this test, run:

```
atlas schema test --env dev
```

The output should be similar to:

```shell
-- PASS: view (1ms)
    schema.test.hcl:6: Seeded the user's table
    schema.test.hcl:17: Tested the view
    schema.test.hcl:33: Table is as expected
PASS
```

### Table Driven Test

Another alternative is to write a [table driven test](/testing/schema#table-driven-tests). This
test uses the `for_each` meta-argument, which accepts a map or a set of values and is used to generate
a test case for each item in the set or map.

Following similar logic to the example above, our table drive test will:
1. Seed data into the `users` table.
2. Run a query on the `clean_users` view.
3. Ensure the data is retrieved as expected.

```hcl title="schema.test.hcl"
test "schema" "view" {
  for_each = [
    {id = 1, name = "Alice"},
    {id = 2, name = "Bob"},
    {id = 3, name = "Charlie"}
  ]
  # Seed the `users` table.
  exec {
    sql = "INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob'), (3, 'Charlie');"
  }
  # Query the `clean_users` view.
  exec {
    sql = "SELECT id, name FROM clean_users WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);"
  }
  # Check each ID returns the right user.
  log {
    message = "Testing ${each.value.id} -> ${each.value.name}"
  }
}
```

To run this test, run:

```
atlas schema test --env dev
```

The output should be similar to:

```shell
-- PASS: view/1 (3ms)
    schema.test.hcl:62: Testing 1 -> Alice
-- PASS: view/2 (633µs)
    schema.test.hcl:62: Testing 2 -> Bob
-- PASS: view/3 (643µs)
    schema.test.hcl:62: Testing 3 -> Charlie
PASS
```
