Testing your database schema and migrations is crucial to ensure code behaves as expected, catch bugs early,
and prevent regressions. Databases enforce logic, constraints, and complex relationships,
so testing ensures these elements work correctly and remain intact after changes.

In this guide we will learn how to use Atlas's [`schema test`](/testing/schema) command to test database functions.

## Database Functions

Functions are predefined operations stored in a database that can be invoked to perform calculations, manipulate data,
or execute tasks.

:::info [Atlas Pro Feature](/features#pro-plan)
Functions are currently available only to [Atlas Pro users](/features#pro-plan). To use this feature, run:

## Project Setup

### Schema File
For this example, let's assume we have the following schema, including a function:

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
schema "public" {
}

table "users" {
  schema = schema.public
  column "id" {
    type = int
  }
  column "name" {
    type = text
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [
      column.id
    ]
  }
}

table "transactions" {
  schema = schema.public
  column "id" {
    type = int
  }
  column "user_id" {
    type = int
  }
  column "amount" {
    type = decimal
  }
// highlight-start
  column "is_income" {
    type = boolean
    as {
      expr = "positive(amount)"
    }
// highlight-end
  }

  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }

  foreign_key "user_fk" {
    columns = [column.user_id]
    ref_columns = [table.users.column.id]
    on_delete = CASCADE
    on_update = NO_ACTION
  }
}

// highlight-start
function "positive" {
  schema = schema.public
  lang   = SQL
  arg "v" {
    type = decimal
  }
  return = boolean
  as     = "SELECT v > 0"
}
// highlight-end
```

In the schema above we have a simple `users` table and a `transactions` table. In `transactions`, the `is_income` column
checks if the `amount` is positive by calling the `positive` function.

Note that `is_income` is a [generated column](/atlas-schema/hcl#generated-columns), meaning its value is
computed using other columns or deterministic expressions (in this case, via a function).

### Config File

Before we begin testing, create a [config file](/atlas-schema/projects#project-files) named
`atlas.hcl`.

In this file we will create an environment, specify the source of our schema,
and a URL for our [dev database](/concepts/dev-database).

We will also create a file named `schema.test.hcl` to write our tests, and
add it to the `atlas.hcl` file in the test block.

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "dev" {
  src = "file://schema.hcl"
  dev = "docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public"

  # Test configuration for local development.
  test {
    schema {
      src = ["schema.test.hcl"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Writing Tests

### Simple Test

Let's start off with a simple test that will check that the function correctly recognizes positive numbers.

```hcl title="schema.test.hcl"
test "schema" "positive_func" {
  parallel = true
  assert {
    sql = "SELECT positive(1)"
  }
  log {
    message = "First assertion passed"
  }
  assert {
    sql = <<SQL
SELECT NOT positive(0);
SELECT NOT positive(-1);
SQL
  }
 log {
    message = "Second assertion passed"
  }
}
```

The test first checks if positive(1) returns TRUE, and then verifies in the second assertion that
positive(0) and positive(-1) return false.

Run the test by running:

```bash
atlas schema test --env dev
```

The output should look similar to:
```testoutput title="Test Output"
-- PASS: positive_func (2ms)
    schema.test.hcl:74: First assertion passed
    schema.test.hcl:83: Second assertion passed
PASS
```

### Table Driven Test

Another alternative is to write a [table driven test](/testing/schema#table-driven-tests). This
test uses the `for_each` meta-argument, which accepts a map or a set of values and is used to generate
a test case for each item in the set or map.

Following similar logic to the test above, we will check the function for the integers: 0, 1, and -1.

```hcl title="schema.test.hcl"
test "schema" "positive_func" {
  parallel = true
  for_each = [
    {input: 1, expected: "t"},
    {input: 0, expected: "f"},
    {input: -1, expected: "f"},
  ]
  exec {
    sql = "SELECT positive(${each.value.input})"
    output = each.value.expected
  }
}
```

Run the test by running:

```bash
atlas schema test --env dev
```

The output should look similar to:
```testoutput title="Test Output"
-- PASS: positive_func/2 (5ms)
-- PASS: positive_func/3 (10ms)
-- PASS: positive_func/1 (10ms)
PASS
```
