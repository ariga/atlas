title: Running Atlas in Docker
id: atlas-in-docker
slug: atlas-in-docker
---
Atlas ships as a set of official [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/arigaio/atlas) for you to use.

To run Atlas in Docker, execute:

```shell
docker run --rm -it arigaio/atlas:latest-alpine
```

Depending on your use case, you may want to use a different image type:

| Base Image | Image Tags                    | Purpose                                        |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Distroless | `latest`, `latest-distroless` | Bare bone image containing only Atlas          |
| Alpine     | `latest-alpine`               | Alpine based image, with basic shell (/bin/sh) |

## Common Issues

### `Use 'atlas login' to access this feature`

Atlas is an open-core project, with some features available only to signed-in users.  To use these features, you
must sign in to Atlas.  To sign in:

1. Run:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -it \
 //highlight-next-line
    -v ~/.atlas:/root/.atlas \
    arigaio/atlas:latest login
  ```

2. Atlas will provide you with a URL to visit in your browser:

  ```
  Please visit:

  https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/login?cli=ade66529-e6c0-4c56-8311-e23d0efe9ee9&port=33281

  Follow the instructions on screen. (Hit <ENTER> to manually provide the code.)
  ```

3. Visit the URL in your browser and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Copy the code provided by Atlas Cloud:

5. Paste the code back into the terminal where you ran `atlas login` and hit `<ENTER>`:
   ```
   Please enter the auth code:
   ```

6. Atlas will verify your code and provide you with a success message:
   ```
   You are now connected to acme-corp-1337-ltd on Atlas Cloud.
   ```

7. You can now use Atlas features that require authentication. Use the `-v ~/.atlas:/root/.atlas` flag to persist your
   login credentials across Docker runs. For example:

   ```shell
    docker run --rm -it \
   //highlight-next-line
      -v ~/.atlas:/root/.atlas \
      arigaio/atlas:latest-alpine schema inspect --url "<url>"
    ```

### `"docker": executable file not found in $PATH`

Atlas heavily relies on the presence of a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) for various calculations
and schema normalization.  To use a Dev Database, users provide Atlas with the URL to connect to an empty
database of the type they wish to operate on.

To streamline work with Dev Databases, Atlas provides a convenience driver named `docker://`, in which Atlas
depends on the Docker CLI command `docker` to be present in the runtime environment.  Running Docker-in-Docker
is a notoriously nuanced topic and so we do not ship `docker` in the distributed Atlas images.

For this reason, Atlas users who wish to run Atlas in Docker, cannot, by default use the `docker://` driver.

#### Workaround: Spin up a local database container and use it

A common workaround is to spin up a local, empty database container and connect to it.

1. Create a Docker Network to establish network connectivity between your local DB and Atlas:
  ```
  docker network create db-network
  ```
2. Run the database:
  ```
  docker run --name pg-dev-db --network db-network -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:16
  ```
3. Use the new dev db:
  ```
  docker run --rm --network db-network \
    -v $PWD:/data \
    arigaio/atlas migrate diff \
    --to file:///data/schema.hcl \
    --dir file:///data/migrations \
    --dev-url "postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@pg-dev:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
  ```
  Note a few things about this command:
  * We use the `--network` flag to use the network we created for our dev database on step 1.
  * We mount our local dir as `/data`
  * We use the URL for our dev database as the `--dev-url` flag, note that the hostname `pg-dev` was specified in step
    2 as the container name.
