title: Running Atlas in Docker

Atlas ships as a set of official [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/arigaio/atlas) for you to use.

To run Atlas in Docker, execute:

```shell
docker run --rm arigaio/atlas
```

Depending on your use case, you may want to use a different image type:

| Base Image | Image Tags                    | Purpose                                        |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Distroless | `latest`, `latest-distroless` | Bare bone image containing only Atlas          |
| Alpine     | `latest-alpine`               | Alpine based image, with basic shell (/bin/sh) |

## Common Issues

### `"docker": executable file not found in $PATH`

Atlas heavily relies on the presence of a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) for various calculations
and schema normalization.  To use a Dev Database, users provide Atlas with the URL to connect to an empty
database of the type they wish to operate on.

To streamline work with Dev Databases, Atlas provides a convenience driver named `docker://`, in which Atlas
depends on the Docker CLI command `docker` to be present in the runtime environment.  Running Docker-in-Docker
is a notoriously nuanced topic and so we do not ship `docker` in the distributed Atlas images.

For this reason, Atlas users who wish to run Atlas in Docker, cannot, by default use the `docker://` driver.

#### Workaround 1: Spin up a local database container and use it

A common workaround is to spin up a local, empty database container and connect to it.

1. Create a Docker Network to establish network connectivity between your local DB and Atlas:
  ```
  docker network create db-network
  ```
2. Run the database:
  ```
  docker run --name pg-dev-db --network db-network -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:16
  ```
3. Use the new dev db:
  ```
  docker run --rm --network db-network \
    -v $PWD:/data \
    arigaio/atlas migrate diff \
    --to file:///data/schema.hcl \
    --dir file:///data/migrations \
    --dev-url "postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@pg-dev:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
  ```
  Note a few things about this command:
  * We use the `--network` flag to use the network we created for our dev database on step 1.
  * We mount our local dir as `/data`
  * We use the URL for our dev database as the `--dev-url` flag, note that the hostname `pg-dev` was specified in step
    2 as the container name.
