Database credentials are considered sensitive information and should be treated as such. In this guide,
we will show how to use Atlas to handle database credentials in a secure manner.  We will present two strategies
for handling database credentials, and show how to use Atlas to implement them: IAM Authentication and Secret Stores.

## Secret Stores

Secret stores are systems or services that allow users to store and retrieve sensitive information. The main features
of secret stores are encryption, access control, and auditing.  All cloud providers offer some form of secret store
service, and there are also many open-source alternatives.  

When working with secret stores, Atlas assumes that the secret store is already provisioned and configured.  Atlas
supports the following secret stores:

* [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
* [GCP Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)

Support for other secret stores is planned, if you have a specific request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/new).

## IAM Authentication

IAM authentication is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate to a database using their cloud provider credentials.
The main advantage of IAM authentication is that it allows users to avoid storing database credentials altogether. Although
setting this up, it is considered a best practice for many cloud providers.  IAM authentication is also more secure than 
using passwords. Even strong passwords stored in encrypted form can be leaked and used by attackers. IAM authentication
allows users to avoid storing database credentials altogether.

IAM authentication is currently supported on GCP and AWS.  Support for other cloud providers is planned as well,
if you have a specific request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/new).

## Retrieving credentials from a secret store

Atlas can retrieve information from a secret store at runtime using the `runtimevar` data source.  The `runtimevar`
data source uses the [`runtimevar` package](https://gocloud.dev/howto/runtimevar/) from the Go [CDK](https://gocloud.dev/).
To read more about using `runtimevar` with Atlas, view the [data source documentation](atlas-schema/projects#data-source-runtimevar).

values={[
{label: 'AWS Secret Manager', value: 'aws-secret-manager'},
{label: 'GCP Secret Manager', value: 'gcp-secret-manager'},
]}>
<TabItem value="aws-secret-manager">

1. Create a secret a secret to store the database password using the AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    aws secretsmanager create-secret \
      --name db-pass-demo \
      --secret-string "p455w0rd"
    ```

    The CLI prints out:

    ```text
    {
        "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:1111111111:secret:db-pass-demo-aBiM5k",
        "Name": "db-pass-demo",
        "VersionId": "b702431d-174f-4a8f-aee5-b80e687b8bf1"
    }
    ```

    Note the database secret name and the region (`us-east-1`), we will use them in the next part.

2. Create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

    ```hcl
    data "runtimevar" "pass" {
      url = "awssecretsmanager://db-pass-demo?region=us-east-1"
    }

    env "dev" {
      url = "mysql://root:${data.runtimevar.pass}@host:3306/database"
    }
    ```

    Let's breakdown the configuration:
    * The `runtimevar` data source is used to retrieve the database password from AWS Secrets Manager.
    * We define an `env` named `dev`.  The value retrieved by the `runtimevar` data source
       is interpolated into the `url` attribute using the `${data.runtimevar.pass}` expression.

3. Run `atlas schema inspect --env dev` to verify that Atlas is able to connect to the database.
