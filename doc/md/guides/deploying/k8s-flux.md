title: Deploying to Kubernetes with the Atlas Operator and Argo CD
slug: /guides/deploying/k8s-argo
---

[GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) is a software development and deployment methodology that uses Git as the central repository
for both code and infrastructure configurations, enabling automated and auditable deployments.

[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) is a Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool that implements GitOps principles.
It uses a declarative approach to deploy applications to Kubernetes, ensuring that the desired state of the 
application is always maintained.

[Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) are software extensions to 
Kubernetes that enable the automation and management of complex, application-specific operational tasks and 
domain-specific knowledge within a Kubernetes cluster.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use the [Atlas Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/kubernetes/operator) and 
ArgoCD to achieve a GitOps-based deployment workflow for your database schema.

## Pre-requisites

* A running Kubernetes cluster  - For learning purposes, you can use 
 [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), which is a tool that runs a single-node
 Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - a command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - a package manager for Kubernetes.

## High-level architecture

Before we dive into the details of the deployment flow, let’s take a look at the high-level architecture of our application.

![Application Architecture](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/k8s/argocd/app-diagram.png)

On a high level, our application consists of the following components:

1. A backend application - in our example we will use a plain NGINX server
   as a placeholder for a real backend application.
2. A database - in our example we will use a MySQL pod for the database.
   In a more realistic scenario, you might want to use a managed database service like AWS RDS or GCP Cloud SQL.
3. An `AtlasSchema`  Custom Resource that defines the database schema and is managed by the Atlas Operator.

In our application architecture, we have a database that is connected to our application and managed using 
Atlas CR (Custom Resource). The database plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving data for the application,
while the Atlas CR provides seamless integration and management of the database schema within our Kubernetes environment.

## How should you run schema changes in an Argo CD deployment? 

Integrating GitOps practices with a database in our application stack poses a unique challenge. 

Argo CD provides a declarative approach to GitOps, allowing us to define an Argo CD application
and seamlessly handle the synchronization process. By pushing changes to the database schema or 
application code to the Git repository, Argo CD automatically syncs those changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

However, as we discussed in the [introduction](/guides/deploying/intro#running-migrations-as-part-of-deployment-pipelines),
ensuring the proper order of deployments is critical. In our scenario, the database deployment
must succeed before rolling out the application to ensure its functionality. If the database deployment
encounters an issue, it is essential to address it before proceeding with the application deployment. 

Argo CD provides [Sync Waves](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/) 
and Sync Hooks as features that help to control the order in which 
manifests are applied within an application. Users may add an annotation to each resource
to specify in which "wave" it should be applied. Argo CD will then apply the resources in the order of the waves.

By using annotations with specific order numbers, you can determine the sequence of manifest applications. 
Lower numbers indicate the earlier application and negative numbers are also allowed.

To ensure that database resources are created and applied before our application, 
we will utilize Argo CD Sync Waves. The diagram shows our application deployment order:

![Application Architecture](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/k8s/argocd/deployment-flow.png)

To achieve the above order we'll annotate each resource with a sync wave annotation order number:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "<order-number>"
```

For more information refer to the [official documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/).

With the theoretical background out of the way, let’s take a look at a practical example of how to deploy an application
with Argo CD and the Atlas Operator.

## Installation

### 1. Install ArgoCD

To install ArgoCD run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Wait until all the pods in the `argocd` namespace are running:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n argocd
```

`kubectl` will print something like this:

```bash
pod/argocd-application-controller-0 condition met
pod/argocd-applicationset-controller-69dbc8585c-6qbwr condition met
pod/argocd-dex-server-59f89468dc-xl7rg condition met
pod/argocd-notifications-controller-55565589db-gnjdh condition met
pod/argocd-redis-74cb89f466-gzk4f condition met
pod/argocd-repo-server-68444f6479-mn5gl condition met
pod/argocd-server-579f659dd5-5djb5 condition met
```

For more information or if you run into some error refer to the
[Argo CD Documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

### 2. Install the Atlas Operator

```bash
helm install atlas-operator oci://ghcr.io/ariga/charts/atlas-operator
```

Helm will print something like this:

```bash
Pulled: ghcr.io/ariga/charts/atlas-operator:0.1.9
Digest: sha256:4dfed310f0197827b330d2961794e7fc221aa1da1d1b95736dde65c090e6c714
NAME: atlas-operator
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Jun 27 16:58:30 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

Wait until the atlas-operator pod is running:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=atlas-operator -n default
```

`kubectl` will print something like this:

```bash
pod/atlas-operator-866dfbc56d-qkkkn condition met
```

For more information on the installation process refer to the [Atlas Operator Documentation](/integrations/kubernetes/operator#getting-started)

## Define the application manifests

### 1. Set up a Git repo

Argo CD works by tracking changes to a Git repository and applying them to the cluster, so let's
set up a Git repository to serve as the central storage for all your application configuration.

In this example, we’re using the [rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo](https://github.com/rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo)
repository, which contains all of the Kubernetes manifests necessary to deploy our application.

### 2. Define the database resources

Recall that in our first sync-wave, we want to deploy the database resources to our cluster. For the
purposes of this example we're deploying a simple MySQL pod to our cluster, but in a realistic scenario
you will probably want to use a managed database service such as AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL or one of the available
database operators for Kubernetes.

In your repository, create a new directory named `manifests` and under it create a new file named `db.yaml`:

```yaml title="manifests/db.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
   annotations:
      argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "0"
   name: mysql
spec:
   ports:
      - port: 3306
   selector:
      app: mysql
   clusterIP: None
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
   annotations:
      argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "0"
   name: mysql
spec:
   selector:
      matchLabels:
         app: mysql
   template:
      metadata:
         labels:
            app: mysql
      spec:
         containers:
            - image: mysql:8
              name: mysql
              env:
                 - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
                   value: pass
                 - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
                   value: example
              readinessProbe:
                 tcpSocket:
                    port: 3306
                 initialDelaySeconds: 10
                 periodSeconds: 10
              livenessProbe:
                 tcpSocket:
                    port: 3306
                 initialDelaySeconds: 15
                 periodSeconds: 15
              ports:
                 - containerPort: 3306
                   name: mysql
```

### 3. Create the AtlasSchema Custom Resource

Create the AtlasSchema custom resource to define the desired schema for your database, 
refer to the [Atlas Operator documentation](/integrations/kubernetes/operator#configuration-for-the-atlasschema-resource) 
and determine the specifications, such as the desired database schema, configuration options, and additional parameters.

Here we’re creating a ***users*** table in an ***example*** database and annotating it with a sync wave order number of 1. 
This annotation informs Argo CD to deploy them after the database has been successfully deployed.

```yaml title="schema.yaml"
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasSchema
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"
  name: myapp
spec:
  url: mysql://root:pass@mysql:3306/example
  schema:
    sql: |
      create table users (
        id int not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(255) not null,
        email varchar(255) unique not null,
        short_bio varchar(255) not null,
        primary key (id)
      );
```


### 4. Create your backend application deployment

For the purpose of this guide, we will deploy a simple NGINX server to act as a placeholder for a real
backend server. Notice that we annotate the backend deployment with a sync wave order number of 2. 
This informs Argo CD to deploy the backend application after the Atlas CR is deployed and confirmed to be in healthy.

```yaml title="app.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 5. Create a custom health check for Atlas objects

To decide whether a SyncWave is complete and the next SyncWave can be started, Argo CD performs 
a health check on the resources in the current SyncWave. If the health check fails, Argo CD will 
not proceed with the next SyncWave.

Argo CD has built-in health assessment for standard Kubernetes types, such as `Deployment` and `ReplicaSet`,
but it does not have a built-in health check for custom resources such as `AtlasSchema`. 

To bridge this gap, Argo CD supports custom health checks written in [Lua](https://lua.org), 
allowing us to define our custom health assessment logic for the Atlas custom resource.

To define the custom logic for the Atlas object in Argo CD, we can add 
the custom health check configuration to the ***argocd-cm*** ConfigMap. 
This ConfigMap is a global configuration for Argo CD that should be placed 
in the same namespace as the rest of the Argo CD resources. Below is a custom 
health check for the Atlas object:

```yaml title="argocd-cm.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  resource.customizations: |
    db.atlasgo.io/AtlasSchema:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        if obj.status ~= nil then
          if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
            for i, condition in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do
              if condition.type == "Ready" and condition.status == "False" then
                hs.status = "Degraded"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
              if condition.type == "Ready" and condition.status == "True" then
                hs.status = "Healthy"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
            end
          end
        end

        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Waiting for reconciliation"
        return hs
```

### 6. Create the Argo CD Application manifest

Finally, create an Argo CD ***Application.yaml***  file which defines our Argo application:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: atlas-argocd-demo
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  source:
    path: manifests
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo' # <-- replace with your repo URL
    targetRevision: master # <-- replace with your mainline
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    retry:
      limit: 5
      backoff:
        duration: 5s
        maxDuration: 3m0s
        factor: 2
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

## Deploying 

Make sure all of these files are pushed to your Git repository. If you want to follow along
you can use the [example repository](https://github.com/rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo) for this guide.

### 1. Apply the custom health check

Before deploying our application, we need to apply the custom health check configuration to the Argo CD ConfigMap.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo/master/argo-cm.yaml -n argocd
```

### 2. Deploy our application

With the custom health check in place, we can now deploy our application.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rotemtam/atlas-argocd-demo/master/Application.yaml
```

Once you create an Argo CD application, Argo automatically pulls the configuration files from your Git 
repository and applies them to your Kubernetes cluster. As a result, the corresponding resources are
created based on the manifests. This streamlined process ensures that the desired state of your 
application is synchronized with the actual state in the cluster.

To verify  the application is successfully deployed and the resources are healthy:

```bash
kubectl get -n argocd applications.argoproj.io atlas-argocd-demo -o=jsonpath='{range .status.resources[*]}{"\n"}{.kind}: {"\t"} {.name} {"\t"} ({.status}) {"\t"} ({.health}){end}'
```
`kubectl` will print something like this:

```
Service: 	     mysql 	 (Synced) 	 ({"status":"Healthy"})
Deployment: 	 mysql 	 (Synced) 	 ({"status":"Healthy"})
Deployment: 	 nginx 	 (Synced) 	 ({"status":"Healthy"})
AtlasSchema: 	 myapp 	 (Synced) 	 ({"message":"The schema has been applied successfully. Apply response: {\"Changes\":{}}","status":"Healthy"})%
```

Finally, on the ArgoCD UI we can see the health and dependency and status of all the resources:

![ArgoCD UI](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/k8s/argocd/argo-flow.png)

## Conclusion

In this guide, we demonstrated how to use Argo CD to deploy an application that uses the Atlas Operator 
to manage the lifecycle of the database schema. We also showed how to use Argo CD's custom health check
to ensure that the schema changes were successfully applied before deploying the backend application.

Using the techniques described in this guide, you can now integrate schema management into your CI/CD
pipeline and ensure that your database schema is always in sync with your application code.
