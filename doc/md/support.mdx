We invest a lot of time and resources in this documentation to make Atlas as easy to use as possible. However,
sometimes you may encounter some issues that you could use some help with. We are here to help you!

<div class="alert alert--secondary">

## Community Support

Atlas is a community project, and we have a community of users and developers that are happy to help you out. You can
reach out to the community in the following ways:

* [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/zZ6sWVg6NT) and ask your question in the `#getting-started` or `#support` channels.
* [Create a new issue](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

At [Ariga](https://ariga.io), the company building Atlas, we constantly monitor both channels and will try to help you out as soon
as possible. However, we are a small team and we can't guarantee a response time. If you need a guaranteed response
time, consider commercial support.
