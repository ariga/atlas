We invest a lot of time and resources in this documentation to make Atlas as easy to use as possible. However,
sometimes you encounter some issues that you could use some help with. We are here to help you!

## Community Support

Atlas is a community project, and we have a community of users and developers that are happy to help you out. You can
reach out to the community in the following ways:

* [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/zZ6sWVg6NT) and ask your question in the `#getting-started` or `#support` channels.
* [Create a new issue](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

## Commercial Support

[Ariga](https://ariga.io), the company building Atlas, is happy to provide commercial support for Atlas. Commercial support
by the team that builds Atlas is available to all paying users of [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud/pricing) and as a
separate subscription for self-hosted users.
