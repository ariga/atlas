## Overview

This document provides an overview of how Atlas Schema Monitoring works. It describes the high level architecture,
key capabilities and features.

### Architecture

Atlas Cloud never has direct access to your database, instead it uses a middleman, the Atlas agent, to connect to your
database instead. In order for this to work, the agent needs to be installed somewhere with network connectivity to the
database, usually within the same VPC as the database to obtain. In addition, it needs to be able to connect to Atlas
Cloud.

The agent then starts polling Atlas Cloud for work. Once assigned a task, it connects to the database and executes the
task, e.g. "take a snapshot" and then reports back the result to Atlas Cloud. The Agent does not read or report back
any user data, only meta information about the database schema.

### Key Capabilities

#### Documentation

Schema Monitoring provides a set of tools and features to help you manage and monitor your database schema effectively.
In addition to a nice ERD visualization of your database schema, you get auto generated Go-style like documentation of
your database schema.

#### Schema Changelog

Once configured, the Atlas agent periodically checks the database schema and if there is a change, reports it back to
the cloud where you can see detailed information about the changes detected.

#### Drift Detection

If you have also set up deployment reporting to Atlas Cloud, Atlas can check if the actual state of your schema matches
the expected one if there is a drift, e.g. because someone manually made a change to the database schema. If Atlas
detects such a drift, you will see it in the Change Log.
