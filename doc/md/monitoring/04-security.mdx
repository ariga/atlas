title: Security and Credentials
---

Atlas Schema Monitoring is designed with the principle of minimal access in mind. The Atlas agent is designed to only
require read-only access to the database schema and only requires access to system information schema tables and not
user data.

Additionally, to provide further security and control, database credentials are never provided or stored in the Atlas
Cloud control plane. Instead, the Atlas agent is deployed in your environment and connects to the database directly
using a variety of secure methods.

## Providing credentials to the Atlas Agent

To be able to monitor the database schema, the Atlas agent needs to be able to connect to the database. However,
to provide an additional layer of security, the Atlas agent does not store the database credentials in the Atlas Cloud
control plane. Instead, the credentials are provided to the agent at deployment time.

The Atlas Agent supports to following methods to provide database credentials:

1. Environment variables
2. Cloud IAM Roles
3. Secret managers

### Environment variables

The simplest way to provide database credentials to the Atlas agent is to use environment variables. The agent
runs as a container on the user's infrastructure. As such, users may provide custom environment variables
to the agent which can be read by the agent at run-time and used as database credentials.

### Cloud IAM Roles

Modern cloud providers support database authentication using IAM roles. The Atlas agent runs as a container on
the user's infrastructure. As such, users may provide the agent with an IAM role that has the necessary permissions
to connect to the database. The agent will then use the IAM role to authenticate with the database.

### Secret managers

Secret managers are a secure way to store and manage sensitive information such as database credentials. The Atlas
agent supports connecting to secret managers to retrieve database credentials. The agent can be configured to connect
to a secret manager and retrieve the necessary credentials at run-time.
