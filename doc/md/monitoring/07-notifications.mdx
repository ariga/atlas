After setting up the notification, you will receive notifications whenever there are a schema changes in the database.

Lest create new table in our database and see how the notification works.

CREATE TABLE test_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

Now, hit the **Refresh** button inside the **Overview** tab to trigger schema snapshot of the database.
