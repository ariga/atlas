It is sometimes useful to be able to calculate the diff between two
databases. For instance, as you are developing you may want to calculate
how to move from an existing database to some other state that you are
interested in. Alternatively, you may be diagnosing some issue and want
to verify there is no difference between a local copy of a schema and a
remote one. 

To accommodate these types of use-cases, Atlas supports the `schema diff`
command. This command connects to two given databases, inspects
them, calculates the difference in their schemas, and prints a plan of
SQL statements to migrate the "from" database to the schema of the "to" database.

### Flags
* `--from` (required) - the [URL](/concepts/url) of the database to calculate the 
 diff from. Currently requires a URL to a specific schema (named database).
* `--to` (required) - the [URL](/concepts/url) of the database to calculate the
  diff to. Currently requires a URL to a specific schema (named database).

### Examples

<Tabs
defaultValue="mysql"
values={[
{label: 'MySQL', value: 'mysql'},
{label: 'MariaDB', value: 'maria'},
{label: 'PostgreSQL', value: 'postgres'},
]}>
<TabItem value="mysql">

Diff to a remote schema
```
atlas schema diff --from "mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/schema" --to "mysql://user:pass@remote:3306/schema"
```

Diff to another schema in the same database
```
atlas schema diff --from "mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/schema" --to "mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/other"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maria">

Diff to a remote schema
```
atlas schema diff --from "maria://user:pass@localhost:3306/schema" --to "maria://user:pass@remote:3306/schema"
```

Diff to another schema in the same database
```
atlas schema diff --from "maria://user:pass@localhost:3306/schema" --to "maria://user:pass@localhost:3306/other"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgres">

Diff to a remote schema:
```
atlas schema diff --from "postgres://localhost:5432/database?search_path=schema" --to "postgres://remote:5432/database?search_path=schema"
```

Diff to another schema in the same database
```
atlas schema diff --from "postgres://localhost:5432/database?search_path=schema" --to "postgres://localhost:5432/database?search_path=other"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
