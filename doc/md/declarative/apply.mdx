With Atlas, users do not need to plan database schema changes themselves. Instead
of figuring out the correct SQL statements to get their database to the desired state,
declarative schema migrations only require the user to provide the desired schema and
a connection string to the target database, and can get a migration plan that is tailor-made
to the specific database engine they are working against.

### Auto-approval
Before executing the migration against the target database, Atlas will print the SQL
queries that it is going to run and prompt the user for approval. Users that wish
to automatically approve may run the `schema apply` command with the `--auto-approve`
flag.

### Dry-runs
In order to skip the execution of the SQL queries against the target database,
users may provide the `--dry-run` flag. When invoked with this flag, Atlas will
connect to the target database, inspect its current state, calculate the diff
between the provided desired schema and print out a series of SQL queries to
reconcile any gaps between the inspected and desired schemas.

### Dev-database
When storing schema definitions, many database engines perform some form of
normalization. That is, despite us providing a specific definition of some
aspect of the schema, the database will store it in another, equivalent form.
This means in certain situations it may appear to Atlas as if some diff exists
between the desired and inspected schemas, whereas in reality there is none.

To overcome these situations, users may use the `--dev-url` flag to provide
Atlas with a connection string to a _Dev-Database_.
This database is used to normalize the schema prior to planning migrations and
for simulating changes to ensure their applicability before execution.
