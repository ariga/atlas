The `atlas schema plan` command allows users to pre-plan declarative schema migrations before applying them to the
database. Once a migration is planned, reviewed, and approved, it can be applied using the [`atlas schema apply`](./apply.mdx)
command to update the database to the desired state.

Note: If you are not familiar with the `atlas schema apply` command, please refer to the [Applying Changes](./apply.mdx)
guide first.

:::info [Atlas Pro Feature](/features#pro)
The `atlas schema plan` command is available exclusively to Pro users. To use this feature, run:
```
atlas login
```
:::

### Overview

The `atlas schema apply` command updates the database to the desired state defined by the user. These auto-planned schema
changes can be approved in one of the following ways:

1. Reviewed and approved interactively by a human.
2. Auto-approved using the `--auto-approve` flag, though this may be risky in a production database.
3. Auto-reviewed based on the lint-review policy, which requires human review only if the linter detects issues. or errors.

These options depend on the database state and cannot predict whether the migration will succeed, fail, or abort.
This is where `atlas schema plan` becomes useful.

The `atlas schema plan` command allows users to pre-plan, review, and approve migrations before executing `atlas schema apply`
on the database. This enables users to preview and modify SQL changes, involve team members in the review process, and ensure
that no human intervention is required during the `atlas schema apply` phase.

How does it work? In short (more details below), `atlas schema plan` generates a migration plan for the specified
_Schema Transition_ (State1 -> State2) and stores it in the [Atlas Registry](/cloud/features/registry). During
`atlas schema apply`, Atlas checks if there is an approved migration plan for the specific schema transition and applies
it without recalculating SQL changes at runtime or requiring user-approval.

If users wish to modify the auto-generated migration plan, they can edit it locally and then push it to the Atlas Registry.

### Local Example

Let's consider a simple example. We have a table `users` with two columns `id` and `name`, and we want to add a new column
`email` to the table.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value={"Schema Definition"}>

```sql title="schema.sql"
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT
//highlight-next-line-info
  email TEXT
);
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value={"Config File"}>

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "local" {
  # URL to the underlying database.
  url = "sqlite://main.db"
  # URL to the dev-database.
  dev = "sqlite://dev?mode=memory"
  schema {
    # Desired schema state.
    src = "file://schema.sql"
    # Atlas Registry config.
    repo {
      name = "app"
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before running `atlas schema plan`, we need to ensure the schema repository exists on the Atlas Registry by running the
following command:

```bash {2}
atlas schema push --env local
https://a8m.atlasgo.cloud/schemas/141733920769
```

We run `atlas schema plan` to generate a migration plan for adding the `email` column to the `users` table:
```bash
atlas schema plan --env local
```
The output looks like this:
```planlog
Planning migration from local database to file://schema.sql (1 statement in total):

  -- add column "email" to table: "users":
    -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;

-------------------------------------------

Analyzing planned statements (1 in total):

  -- no diagnostics found

  -------------------------
  -- 6.028063ms
  -- 1 schema change
? Approve or abort the plan:
  ▸ Approve and push
    Abort
```
Once approved, the migration plan will be pushed to the Atlas Registry, and can be applied using `atlas schema apply`.

```planlog
Plan Status: APPROVED
  -- Atlas URL: atlas://app/plans/20240916133205
  -- Cloud URL: https://a8m.atlasgo.cloud/schemas/141733920769/plans/210453397504
```

At this stage, we can run `atlas schema apply` to apply the changes to the database, on any environment, without
re-calculating the SQL changes at runtime or requiring human intervention.

```applylog
Applying approved migration using pre-planned file 20240916133205 (1 statement in total):

  -- add column "email" to table: "users"
    -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
  -- ok (1.774327ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 1.826882ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 sql statement
```

### Atlas Registry

Atlas Registry allows you to store, version, and maintain a single source of truth for your database schemas and its
migration plans. It is similar to Docker Hub, but for your schemas and migrations. In addition to functioning as storage,
it is schema-aware and provides extra capabilities such as ER diagrams, SQL diffing, [schema docs](/cloud/features/schema-docs),
and more.

### Edit a Plan

One of the first questions that come to mind when comparing the declarative approach to the versioned approach is:
_How can I edit a migration plan?_ There are three ways to edit a migration plan:

1. **Edit in-place:**
   - Ensure the `EDITOR` environment variable is set (e.g., `export EDITOR=vim`).
   - Run `atlas schema plan --edit` to open the plan in the default editor. Upon closing, the plan will be pushed
     after approval.

2. **Save, edit, and push:**
   - Run `atlas schema plan --save` to save the plan to a file and edit it manually.
   - Run `atlas schema plan push --file file://<path>` to push the edited plan to the Atlas Registry.

3. **Pull, edit, and push:**
   - Pull a remote plan by running `atlas schema plan pull --url atlas://<schema>/plans/<plan> > name.plan.hcl`.
   - Open `name.plan.hcl` in the editor, and edit the `migration` attribute.
   - Push the edited plan to the Atlas Registry by running `atlas schema plan push --file file://<path>`.

To complete the example, let's edit the migration plan from the [example above](#local-example) by filling all nullable
`email` columns with a dynamic default value:

1. We pull the plan first into a file named `20240916133205.plan.hcl`:

  ```bash
  atlas schema plan pull --url atlas://app/plans/20240916133205 > 20240916133205.plan.hcl
  ```

  ```hcl title="20240916133205.plan.hcl"
  plan "20240916133205" {
    from      = "vJYpErjN4kWJpw4nRaJcEX3xx/jExj4a05Ll3Y7gXr4="
    to        = "hna312Vk535aibL1hTRcBlxeyUvIwV6Mov7kfaZ2+3s="
    migration = <<-SQL
    -- Add column "email" to table: "users"
    ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
    SQL
  }
  ```

  Note that the `from` and `to` are fingerprints of the schema states. They are used to identify the states in the
  schema transition. We will ignore them for now (without changing them, of course) and focus on the migration attribute.

2. We edit the `migration` attribute to fill all nullable `email` columns with a dynamic default value:

  ```hcl title="20240916133205.plan.hcl"
  plan "20240916133205" {
    from      = "vJYpErjN4kWJpw4nRaJcEX3xx/jExj4a05Ll3Y7gXr4="
    to        = "hna312Vk535aibL1hTRcBlxeyUvIwV6Mov7kfaZ2+3s="
    migration = <<-SQL
    -- Add column "email" to table: "users"
    ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
    //highlight-next-line-info
    -- Fill all nullable "email" columns with a default email.
    //highlight-next-line-info
    UPDATE `users` SET `email` = PRINTF('%s+a8m@atlasgo.cloud', `name`) WHERE `email` IS NULL;
    SQL
  }
  ```

3. Then, we push the edited plan to the Atlas Registry:

  ```bash
  atlas schema plan push --file file://20240916133205.plan.hcl
  ```

  ```planlog
  Planning migration statements (2 in total):

    -- add column "email" to table: "users":
      -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
    -- fill all nullable "email" columns with a default email.:
      -> UPDATE `users` SET `email` = PRINTF('%s+a8m@atlasgo.cloud', `name`) WHERE `email` IS NULL;

  -------------------------------------------

  Analyzing planned statements (2 in total):

    -- no diagnostics found

    -------------------------
    -- 43.566575ms
    -- 2 schema changes
  ? Approve or abort the plan:
    ▸ Approve and push
      Abort
  ```
  Once approved, the migration plan will be pushed to the Atlas Registry.

  :::note Schema Drift
  Note that if your manual changes are not in sync with the desired state (i.e., do not bring the database to the
  desired state), Atlas will detect the schema drift and reject this migration plan.
  :::

4. Then, running `atlas schema apply` will apply the changes to the database, including the new `UPDATE` statement.

   ```applylog
   Applying approved migration using pre-planned file 20240916133205 (2 statements in total):

     -- add column "email" to table: "users"
       -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
     -- ok (826.977µs)

     -- fill all nullable "email" columns with a default email.
       -> UPDATE `users` SET `email` = PRINTF('%s+a8m@atlasgo.cloud', `name`) WHERE `email` IS NULL;
     -- ok (447.152µs)

     -------------------------
     -- 1.353026ms
     -- 1 migration
     -- 2 sql statements
   ```

### Push a Plan

By default, `atlas schema plan` proposes pushing the plan file to the Atlas registry. However, you can use the `--save` flag
to dump the plan to a file, edit it, and then push it manually to the Atlas Registry using the `atlas schema plan push`
command:

```bash
atlas schema plan push \
  --file file://<path-plan-file> \
  --env <config-env>
```

### Approve a Plan

By default, `atlas schema plan` pushes plans in an **`APPROVED`** state to the registry. However, in some cases, we may prefer to create
the plan in **pending** state, and later approve it manually or automatically after it passes the team's review.

There are two ways to create a plan in a **pending** state and approve it after review.
1. Manual workflow:
   1. Run the `atlas schema plan` command with the `--pending` flag. This creates the plan in **pending** state.
   2. Then, in order to approve the plan, either go to the Atlas Registry Web UI and approve the plan, or run the
      `atlas schema plan approve` command.
2. Automated (CI) workflow:
   1. When setting the `schema/plan` GitHub Action for your repository, Atlas automatically creates a plan in a pending state.
   2. Then, after the PR is merged, Atlas auto-approves the created plan in the registry.

:::info Protected Flow
Users can protect their registry schemas by limiting who can push changes, push approved plans, or approve existing plans.
To enable this for your schema, go to the schema repository settings in the registry and enable the `Protected Flows` option.
:::

### Pull a Plan

To pull a plan from the Atlas Registry, use the `atlas schema plan pull` command:

```bash
atlas schema plan pull \
  --url atlas://app/plans/add_email > add_email.plan.hcl
```

### List Plans

To list all plans in the Atlas Registry for the given schema transition, use the `atlas schema plan list` command:

```bash
atlas schema plan list \
  --env local
```

```planlog
Plan Status: APPROVED
  -- Atlas URL: atlas://app/plans/add_email
  -- Cloud URL: https://<tenant>.atlasgo.cloud/schemas/<schema-id>/plans/<plan-id>
```

### Lint a Plan

To lint a plan (remote or local) before pushing it to the Atlas Registry, use the `atlas schema plan lint` command:

```bash
atlas schema plan lint \
  --file file://add_email.plan.hcl \
  --env local
```

### Apply a Plan

Running `atlas schema apply` searches for a migration plan in the Atlas Registry and applies it to the database, if exists.
However, in unusual cases, you might have multiple (approved )migration plans for the same schema transition store in the
registry (e.g., one per environment). In that case, running `atlas schema apply` will abort with the following error:

```text
Error: multiple pre-planned migrations were found in the registry for this schema transition.

  Current hash: vJYpErjN4kWJpw4nRaJcEX3xx/jExj4a05Ll3Y7gXr4=
  Desired hash: hna312Vk535aibL1hTRcBlxeyUvIwV6Mov7kfaZ2+3s=

Plans found:

  atlas://app/plans/<plan-one>
  atlas://app/plans/<plan-two>

To resolve the issue, either delete the conflicting plans or provide the plan URL explicitly using the --plan flag.
```

In this case, we either delete the conflicting plans from the Atlas Registry or provide the plan URL explicitly using
the `--plan` flag:

```applylog
Applying approved migration using pre-planned file 20240916133205 (2 statements in total):

  -- add column "email" to table: "users"
    -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `email` text NULL;
  -- ok (789.621µs)

  -- fill all nullable "email" columns with a default email.
    -> UPDATE `users` SET `email` = PRINTF('%s+a8m@atlasgo.cloud', `name`) WHERE `email` IS NULL;
  -- ok (883.177µs)

  -------------------------
  -- 1.77283ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 2 sql statements
```
