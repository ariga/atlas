Bots are "headless" users that can be used to perform certain actions against the Atlas Cloud API, such as pushing and
reading schema changes from the Registry, or reporting CI and migration statuses. However, bots **cannot be used for local
development** or to access the Atlas Cloud UI.

:::info Token Usage For Local Development
Organizations on the Community (Free) plan cannot use bot tokens for local development, and must use their personal
tokens instead. Personal tokens are issued by running `atlas login` and are limited to the users who created them.
