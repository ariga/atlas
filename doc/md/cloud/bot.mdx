### Background

Bots are "headless" users that can be used to perform certain actions against the Atlas Cloud API.
Common use cases are to report CI build statuses, or to perform automated deployments.

In this guide, we will show how to create a new bot user, and how to create an API key for that bot.

### Creating a Bot User

To create a bot user, make sure you are logged in as an administrator to you Atlas Cloud account.

Follow these steps to create a new bot user:
1. To get to the bot management screen, click on _**Settings > Bots**_ in the left navigation.
