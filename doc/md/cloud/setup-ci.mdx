title: Setting up CI for your Database with Atlas Cloud
---

As your application evolves, so does your database schema. If you're not careful
with schema changes (migrations), you can end up introducing all sorts of issues
that are painful and expensive to fix.

To mitigate the risk of deploying dangerous changes to database schemas, many teams
apply CI/CD practices to their database. This means that every change to the database
schema is automatically reviewed and tested before it is deployed to production.

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up CI for your database using Atlas Cloud.

## GitHub Actions or App Workflows

There are two ways to set up CI for your database with Atlas Cloud:

* **GitHub Action** (recommended) - Install the [`ariga/atlas-action`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action)
  GitHub Action on your GitHub repository and configure it to run on any pull request that modifies your database schema.

  Note, this workflow does _not_ require you to grant Atlas Cloud any permissions on your repository. It also gives you
  more control on how to set it up, and what [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) to use (e.g, PostGIS) for linting, change simulation, etc.

* **GitHub App** - Install the Atlas Cloud GitHub App on your GitHub repository. Atlas Cloud will automatically pull
  changes from your GitHub repository, then run tests on them.

  This workflow is faster to set up, but it does require the necessary permissions to install the GitHub
  App on your repository.


## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository containing an Atlas migration directory. If you don't have one handy
   and would like to experiment with this workflow, you can use the
   [`ariga/atlas-template`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-template) template repo
   to create one for you.
2. An [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud) account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free in
  [auth.atlasgo.cloud](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup), or by running `atlas login` in your terminal:

  ```shell
  $ atlas login
  //highlight-next-line-info
  You are now connected to "a8m" on Atlas Cloud.
  ```

## GitHub Action Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Bot Token for Atlas Cloud

In order to report the results of your CI runs to Atlas Cloud, you will need to
create a bot token for Atlas Cloud to use. Follow [these instructions](/cloud/bot.mdx)
to create a token and save it somewhere safe.

### Step 2: Install the Atlas GitHub CLI Extension

To streamline the process of configuring the GitHub Action, we've created a
GitHub CLI extension that will do most of the work for you:

1. Make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed.

   ```shell
   brew install gh
   ```
   See [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) for more installation options.

2. Install the Atlas GitHub CLI extension:

   ```shell
   gh extension install ariga/gh-atlas
   ```

### Step 3: Configure the GitHub Action

1. **Permissions** - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to configure your action:

  ```shell
  gh auth refresh -s write:packages,workflow
  ```

2. **Go to repo root** - Make sure your current working directory is the root of your repository.

  ```shell
  cd path/to/my/repo
  ```

3. **Run the extension** - Run the `init-ci` command to configure the GitHub Action:

  ```shell
  gh atlas init-action --token <your-bot-token>
  ```
  Atlas will scan your repository (locally) for directories containing Atlas migrations
  and ask you which one you would like to use for CI. Select the desired directory and press "Enter":
  ```text
  Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
  ? choose migration directory:
    ▸ migrations
  ```

  Atlas will then ask you which database driver this directory contains migrations for. Select the
  desired driver and press "Enter":

  ```text
  Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
  ? choose driver:
    ▸ mysql
      postgres
      mariadb
      sqlite
  ```

  Next, the GitHub extension will save your bot token to a GitHub secret and create a
  pull request with the necessary configuration for the GitHub Action.

  </details>


  After reviewing the changes, merge the pull request to enable the GitHub Action.

### Step 4: Test the Action

After merging the pull request, the GitHub Action will run `atlas migrate lint` on every pull request
and sync the migrations to Atlas Cloud on every push to `master`.

1. To test this setup, create a new branch for making some changes to your database schema:

  ```shell
  git checkout -b test-ci
  ```

2. Create a new migration in interactive mode:

  ```shell
  atlas migrate new --edit dummy
  ```

3. Type some broken SQL into the migration file and save it:

  ```sql
  CREATE users (
    col varchar(255)
  );
  ```

  (Notice that we're missing the `TABLE` keyword in the `CREATE TABLE` statement.)

4. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub:

  ```shell
  git add migrations
  git commit -m "migrations: add dummy migration"
  git push origin test-ci
  ```

  Our changes are pushed to GitHub:
  ```
  remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), done.
  remote:
  remote: Create a pull request for 'test-ci' on GitHub by visiting:
  remote:      https://github.com/rotemtam/gh-init-demo/pull/new/test-ci
  remote:
  To github.com:rotemtam/gh-init-demo.git
   * [new branch]      test-ci -> test-ci
  ```

5. Open a pull request for the `test-ci` branch and wait for the GitHub Action to run.

6. Notice that after a few moments, a comment appears on the pull request with the results of the linting run:

  The linting run failed because of the syntax error we introduced in the migration file.

## GitHub App Workflow

### Step 1: Install the Atlas Cloud GitHub App

After logging in to Atlas Cloud, create a new migration directory by clicking on
"Projects" in the sidebar and then click on the "Add Directory"
button.

</details>

### Step 2: Connect Your Repository

Once you've installed the GitHub App, you need to grant it access to
the relevant repositories. Click on the "Organization" field and choose
"Add Organization" from the dropdown:

</details>

A popup requesting you to grant permission to specific repositories will appear.
Select the repositories you want to grant access to, then click "Install and Authorize".

</details>

### Step 3: Configure the Migration Directory

Fill the rest of the form with the relevant configuration details:
* **Directory Path** - The path to the directory containing your migrations relative to your repository root.
* **Directory Name** - An identifier for the directory. This will be used to identify the directory in the Atlas Cloud and APIs.
* **Migration Engine** - The format of the migrations in the directory. Atlas works best with migration directories in its
  format, but also supports `golang-migrate`, Flyway, and Liquibase.
* **Database** - the database engine for the target database.

<details>
<summary>Screenshot Example</summary>

![](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/cloud/ci-guide/create-dir-5.png)
</details>

Click "Connect Directory" to finish the process.

### Step 4: Test the Integration

After connecting your directory, let's create a pull request with a destructive
change to make sure that Atlas Cloud catches it.

Create a new branch:

```
git checkout -b test-branch
```

Create a new migration file:

```
atlas migrate new --edit destructive
```

Add the following SQL to the migration file and save:

```sql
DROP TABLE posts;
```

Commit the changes and push them to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "add destructive migration"
git push origin test-branch
```

Create a pull request from the `test-branch` branch to your main branch.

After a few seconds, Atlas Cloud will pick up the changes and run CI against
them. Shortly after, you will see a comment on your pull request with the
results of the CI run:

<summary>Screenshot Example</summary>

</details>


Amazing! Atlas Cloud caught the destructive change and prevented it from being
accidentally merged to your main branch.

## Summary

In this guide, we've shown how to configure Atlas Cloud to apply continuous integration
for our database schema changes.  With this setup, whenever a developer proposes a change
to the database schema, Atlas Cloud will verify the safety of the change using various checks
and report back the results.
