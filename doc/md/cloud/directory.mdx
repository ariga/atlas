The following guide explains how to connect a migration directory to Atlas Cloud. Once connected, Atlas provides a list
of features enabling users to seamlessly audit their migration history, run continuous migration linting on their PRs,
monitor executed migrations and receive Slack notifications, among other capabilities.

There are two ways for connecting migration directories to Atlas Cloud:

1. **Push mode**: Set up a GitHub Action, [`atlas-sync-action`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-sync-action), to persist
  the desired state of the migration directory in Atlas Cloud. Refer to the [Action documentation](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-sync-action#usage)
  for installation guidance for your project.
2. **Pull mode**: Connect your migration directory stored in GitHub with the Atlas GitHub App. To do so, follow these steps:
   - Navigate to `/dirs` and click on **Add Directory**.
   - Select **Continue with GitHub** and grant Atlas access to the relevant repositories.
   - Once authorized by GitHub, select the path to the migration directory and click **Connect Directory**.

### Slack Integration
You can use Slack Webhooks to receive updates in your Slack channel about schema changes, CI runs and deployment statuses of your migration directory.
Make sure you have a Slack incoming webhook configured
(you can create one [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook)).

Select your migration directory, go to "Webhooks" and click on **Add Webhook**.

Select the Slack integration, Choose the events you want to be notified about and insert your webhook URL.
Click on **Add Webhook** to confirm.

Once the Webhook is created, you will be redirected to the Webhooks page.
Select a webhook to edit its configuration and to view its delivery history.
