title: Get access to beta drivers
---

Atlas Cloud users can get early access to beta drivers by joining the Atlas Cloud Beta Program. To join the program,
you first need to create an account on Atlas Cloud, enable it in your account settings, and then login to the CLI
using your Atlas identity.

### Sign up to Atlas Cloud

The first step is to sign up to [Atlas Cloud](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup). If you already have an account, you can skip this step.

### Opt-in to the beta program

Go to the account settings by clicking your avatar. Then, select the driver you want to get access to. For example,
Microsoft SQL Server.

### Login to the CLI

Then, run `atlas login` to login or update your account permissions:

```text
$ atlas login a8m
//highlight-next-line-info
You are now connected to "a8m" on Atlas Cloud.
```

### Use the beta driver

```bash
atlas schema apply \
  --url "sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master" \
  --to "file://schema.hcl"
```
