## What is Atlas Cloud?

[Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud) is an online platform that supplements the Atlas CLI
to allow teams to build robust, end-to-end schema management workflows. We built it to help
teams make the most out of Atlas with as little friction and effort as possible.

## What can I do with Atlas Cloud?

### For Individuals: Unlock the full power of Atlas CLI

By logging in to Atlas Cloud, get access to enhanced schema management, such as views, triggers, functions and stored procedures.
You will also get access to various database drivers, private visualizations, and more. For a full list of the CLI features
that require login access, click [here](/features#feature-availability).

### For Teams: Take database schema management to the next level
* **[Schema Documentation](/cloud/features/schema-docs)** - Enjoy always up-to-date automatically generated docs for your schema. Atlas Cloud manages a
single source of truth for the database schema in a format that is easy to understand and navigate.

* **[Automatic Code Review](/cloud/setup-ci)** - If you're not careful, it's easy to accidentally deploy a schema migration
 that breaks your application. Atlas Cloud automatically simulates and reviews your migrations during
the CI process to ensure that your migrations are safe to deploy. With the Cloud, you can view detailed reports breaking down
each change and its severity.

* **[Stronger Safety Guarantees](/cloud/features/pre-migration-checks)** - Safeguard deployments with pre-migration checks and interactive migrations.

* **Full Visibility** - Atlas Cloud provides a single pane of glass to view your database schemas, and the status of your migrations across
 all of your environments.

* **[Fast Troubleshooting](/cloud/deployment#visualizing-migration-runs)** - Quickly resolve failed migrations with detailed deployment logs.

* **[Simplify your Pipelines](/cloud/deployment)** - Declutter deployment pipelines by pushing migrations to Atlas Cloud. Atlas Cloud seamlessly
integrates with modern deployment tools like Kubernetes and Terraform to make it easy to deploy your migrations to production
as part of your existing CD process.

* **[Send Notifications](/cloud/directories#slack-integration)** - Notify the right people when schema changes are proposed and deployed via Slack and other integrations.

## How do I get started?

1. **Create an account** - in the [signup page](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup) or from the CLI:

   ```
   atlas login
   ```
2. **Connect a migration directory** - To unlock CI, deployments and visibility features you need to connect a migration
   directory to your account. [Follow this guide](/cloud/directories) to learn how.
3. **Deploy from your connected directory** - Once you've connected a migration directory, you can deploy migrations
   from your Cloud account.  [Follow this guide](/cloud/deployment) to learn how.
