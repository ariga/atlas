### What is Atlas Cloud?

[Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud) is an online platform that supplements the Atlas CLI
to allow teams to build robust, end-to-end schema management workflows.  We built it to help
teams make the most out of Atlas with as little friction and effort as possible.

### What can I do with Atlas Cloud?

* **Store your migration directories in a central location** - Atlas Cloud allows you to push your migrations in a
  central location which greatly simplifies the process of deploying your migrations to
  production.
* **Continuous Integration** - If you're not careful, it's easy to accidentally deploy a schema migration
  that breaks your application.  Atlas Cloud automatically simulates and reviews your migrations during
  the CI process to ensure that your migrations are safe to deploy.
* **Deployments** - Atlas Cloud seamlessly integrates with modern deployment tools like Kubernetes and Terraform
  to make it easy to deploy your migrations to production as part of your existing CD process.
* **Visibility** - Atlas Cloud provides a single pane of glass to view the status of your migrations across
  all of your environments.  You can also view the status of individual migrations to see which migrations
  have been deployed to which environments.

### How do I get started?

1. **Create an account** - in the [signup page](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup) and follow the instructions
   to create an account.
2. **Connect a migration directory** - To unlock CI, deployments and visibility features you need to connect a migration
   directory to your account. [Follow this guide](/cloud/directories) to learn how.
3. **Deploy from your connected directory** - Once you've connected a migration directory, you can deploy migrations
   from your Cloud account.  [Follow this guide](/cloud/deployment) to learn how.

### Can I see a demo?

Yes, head over to our [live demo account](https://gh.atlasgo.cloud) to see Atlas Cloud in action.

### Can I use Atlas Cloud for free?

Atlas Cloud comes with a free "Community" plan which should be more than enough for most teams.

To learn more see the [pricing page](https://atlasgo.cloud/pricing).

### How do I get access to beta drivers?

Atlas Cloud users can get early access to beta drivers by joining the Atlas Cloud Beta Program. To join the program,
you first need to create an account on Atlas Cloud, enable it in your account settings, and then login to the CLI
using your Atlas identity.

1\. Sign up first on [Atlas Cloud](https://auth.atlasgo.cloud/signup).

2\. Go to the account settings by clicking your avatar. Then, select the driver you want to get access to. For example,
Microsoft SQL Server.
