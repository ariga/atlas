Atlas Cloud offers two pricing plans:

1. **Pro Plan** - for individuals and small teams that want to unlock the full potential of Atlas. The Pro plan
   provides full access to advanced CLI capabilities, the Cloud UI, and other features. A free, 30-day trial is available
   for new users. After the trial period, a license is required to continue using Atlas Pro.

  To learn more about Atlas Pro pricing, visit our [pricing page](https://atlasgo.io/pricing).

2. **Enterprise Plan** - for larger organizations looking to solve schema management at scale. This plan includes a
   dedicated support channel, solution engineering, and other features required for adoption by enterprises.

## What are Seats, Projects and Target Databases?

The three dimensions for billing on the Pro plan are seats, projects, and target databases.

**Seats.** Every developer using Atlas Pro from the CLI or the Cloud UI counts as a seat. The Pro plan comes with 3 free
seats per company. Additional seats can be purchased as needed. For seat pricing see [here](/pricing).

**Projects.** For teams using Atlas Cloud, resources are grouped into projects. A Project is
a set of database resources that are versioned and managed together, essentially a *migration directory*.
Each project gets its own page in the Cloud UI under which you will find CI Runs, Deployments, ERDs, documentation
and more. See our [live demo](https://gh.atlasgo.cloud/dirs/4294967383) for an example.

The Pro plan comes with 1 free project. Additional projects can be purchased as needed. For project pricing see [here](/pricing).

**Target Databases.** A project may be deployed to multiple target databases, for instance, a development, staging, and
production database. Atlas Cloud keeps track of each target environment separately, allowing you to deploy to each
environment independently.

Each target database is essentially a unique URL to which a project is deployed.
The Pro plan comes with 2 free target databases. Additional target databases can be purchased as needed. For target
database pricing see [here](/pricing).
