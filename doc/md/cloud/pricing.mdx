Atlas Cloud offers two pricing plans:

1. **Pro Plan** - for individuals and small teams that want to unlock the full potential of Atlas. This plan provides 3
free seats per company and full access to all the capabilities of Atlas as a CLI. The free version of the plan offers access to enough Atlas Cloud
quota to successfully manage a single project.

* For those who need additional seats or quotas (projects, databases, runs, etc.), it is possible to pay as you go. View
the pricing breakdown [here](https://atlasgo.cloud/pricing).

2. **Enterprise Plan** - for larger organizations looking to solve schema management at scale. This plan includes a
dedicated support channel, solution engineering, and other features required for adoption by enterprises.
