Atlas Cloud offers three pricing plans:

1. **Free Plan** - for individuals and small teams that want to unlock the full potential of Atlas. This plan will remain
free forever and provides full access to all the capabilities of Atlas as a CLI as well as access to enough Atlas Cloud
quota to successfully manage a single project. Support is provided via public [community support](https://atlasgo.io/support)
channels.

2. **Business Plan** - for teams professionally using Atlas beyond a single project. This plan has the same features and
capabilities as the Free Plan but allows teams to purchase additional quotas if required. In addition, teams subscribed
to this plan will get access to priority email support and in-app support via Intercom.

3. **Enterprise Plan** - for larger organizations looking to solve schema management at scale. This plan includes a
dedicated support channel, solution engineering, and other features required for adoption by enterprises.
