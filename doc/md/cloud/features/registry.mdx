Atlas Registry allows you to store, version, and maintain a single source of truth for your database schemas,
database migrations, and additional assets related to schema changes. It is like Docker Hub for Atlas schemas and
migrations.

## Getting Started

### Pushing a Schema

The `atlas schema push` command allows you to push your schema definition to the Atlas Registry. If no repository exists
in the registry for the schema, a new one is created. Otherwise, a new version is generated.

```bash {4}
atlas schema push myapp \
  --env local

https://example.atlasgo.cloud/schemas/141733920769
```

Once pushed, the schema is available to others in your organization and can be referenced in your deployment pipelines.

    <p style={{fontSize: 12}}>Schema created with <code>atlas schema push</code></p>
</div>

#### Registry Config for Schemas

The example below demonstrates how to configure the registry for your schema within an `env` block. All commands
executed in this environment will automatically use the configured repository:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {6-13}
env "local" {
  # URL to the underlying database.
  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
  # URL to the dev-database.
  dev = "sqlite://dev?mode=memory"
  schema {
    # Desired schema state.
    src = "file://schema.sql"
    # Atlas Registry config.
    repo {
      name = "myapp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Pushing a Migration Directory

The `atlas migrate push` command allows you to push your migration directory to the Atlas Registry. If no repository
exists in the registry for the pushed directory, a new one is created. Otherwise, the directory state will be updated.

```bash {4}
atlas migrate push myapp \
  --env local

https://example.atlasgo.cloud/dirs/4294967370
```

Once pushed, the migration directory is available to others in your organization and can be referenced in your deployment
pipelines.

Note that Atlas Registry is schema-aware. In addition to storing and versioning your migrations, it provides ER diagrams,
SQL diffing, [schema docs](/cloud/features/schema-docs), and other capabilities that make working with your
schema easier.

    <p style={{fontSize: 12}}>Migration Directory created with <code>atlas migrate push</code></p>
</div>

#### Registry Config for Migration Directories

The example below demonstrates how to configure the registry for your migration directory within an `env` block.
All commands executed in this environment will automatically use the configured repository:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {8-13}
env "local" {
  # URL to the underlying database.
  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
  # URL to the dev-database.
  dev = "sqlite://dev?mode=memory"
  # URL to the desired schema state.
  src = "file://schema.sql"
  migration {
    # Atlas Registry config.
    repo {
      name = "myapp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Simplifying Deployments

When you push a migration directory to the Schema Registry, you can give it a tag in the same way that you would tag a
Docker image. This makes any version of your schema effectively _addressable_ which dramatically simplifies deployments.

References to a schema version can then be used in your deployment pipelines with an expression similar to:

```bash
# Reference by version
atlas migrate apply \
    --dir "atlas://myapp?version=20231201182011" \
    --url "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"

# Reference by tag
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "atlas://app?tag=39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5" \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```

Using the Schema Registry completely eliminates the need to create custom Docker images for migrations or grant your runtime
environments access to your source code repository.

### Example: Kubernetes Deployment

Let's see how we can use tagged schema versions in a Kubernetes deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasMigration
metadata:
  name: migration
spec:
  urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: postgres-credentials
  cloud:
    project: "atlasdemo" # Atlas Cloud project name
    tokenFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: atlas-credentials
        key: token
  dir:
    // highlight-start
    remote:
      name: "myapp" # Migration directory name in your atlas cloud project
      tag: "39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5" # See below on how to obtain this value for your project.
   // highlight-end
```

### Example: Terraform

You can also use references to the Schema Registry in your Terraform modules:

```hcl
resource "atlas_migration" "myapp" {
  url = "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
  // highlight-start
  remote_dir {
    name = "myapp"
    tag  = "39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```
