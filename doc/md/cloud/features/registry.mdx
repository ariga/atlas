### Overview

By pushing your schemas to the Atlas Cloud Schema Registry, teams can maintain a single source of truth for their database
schemas and schema changes. It is like Docker Hub but for database schema changes.

### How it works

Push your migration directory to the Schema Registry by using the `atlas migrate push` command. This will upload your
migration files to the registry and make it available to others in your organization:

```
atlas migrate push --env local helloworld

https://example.atlasgo.cloud/dirs/4294967370
```

### Simplifying Deployments

When you push a migration directory to the Schema Registry, you can give it a tag in the same way that you would tag a
Docker image. This makes any version of your schema effectively _addressable_ which dramatically simplifies deployments.
References to a schema version can then be used in your deployment pipelines with an expression similar to:
```
atlas://
```

```yaml
