## Overview

By pushing your schemas to the Atlas Cloud Schema Registry, teams can maintain a single source of truth for their database
schemas and schema changes. It is like Docker Hub but for database schema changes.

## How it works

Push your migration directory to the Schema Registry by using the `atlas migrate push` command. This will upload your
migration files to the registry and make it available to others in your organization:

```
atlas migrate push --env local helloworld

https://example.atlasgo.cloud/dirs/4294967370
```

## Simplifying Deployments

When you push a migration directory to the Schema Registry, you can give it a tag in the same way that you would tag a
Docker image. This makes any version of your schema effectively _addressable_ which dramatically simplifies deployments.

References to a schema version can then be used in your deployment pipelines with an expression similar to:

```bash
# Reference by version
atlas migrate apply \
    --dir "atlas://myapp?version=20231201182011" \
    --url "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"

# Reference by tag
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "atlas://app?tag=39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5" \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```

Using Schema Registry completely eliminates the need to create custom Docker images for migrations, or grant your runtime
environments access to your source code repository.

### Example: Kubernetes Deployment

Let's see how we can use tagged schema versions in a Kubernetes deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasMigration
metadata:
  name: migration
spec:
  urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: postgres-credentials
  cloud:
    project: "atlasdemo" # Atlas Cloud project name
    tokenFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: atlas-credentials
        key: token
  dir:
    // highlight-start
    remote:
      name: "myapp" # Migration directory name in your atlas cloud project
      tag: "39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5" # See below on how to obtain this value for your project.
   // highlight-end
```

### Example: Terraform

You can also use references to the Schema Registry in your Terraform modules:

```hcl
resource "atlas_migration" "myapp" {
  url = "postgres://postgres:pass@:5432/example?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
  // highlight-start
  remote_dir {
    name = "myapp"
    tag  = "39e7e4e35fce7409bd26d25d8140061695d4ffd5"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```
