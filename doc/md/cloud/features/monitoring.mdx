## Drift Detection

Schema migrations on production databases should ideally be automated within CI/CD pipelines, keeping developers from
needing root access. However, this setup isn't always the case, leading to **Schema Drift**, where database schemas
drift from their intended state, causing inconsistencies and issues.

### Schema Drift
Schema drift is dangerous because it can lead to unexpected behavior in applications, data corruption, and even system outages.
When the actual database schema deviates from the expected schema, queries may fail, data integrity constraints may be violated,
and application logic may break. Additionally, schema migrations are planned based on the assumption the target
database is in a specific state and may fail and cause unknown side effects. This can result in hard-to-debug issues and
degraded system performance, ultimately affecting the reliability and stability of your application.

#### Detecting Schema Drifts
Atlas enables to automatically monitor schema drift by periodically checking if your deployed database schemas align with their desired state.
Since most databases are not openly accessible, Atlas allows the use of Atlas Agents within your database's network.
These agents register themselves with your Atlas Cloud account and continuously poll for tasks, ensuring your
database schemas remain consistent and up-to-date.

You can instruct Atlas to notify you if there is a drift. Atlas supports various channels, such as email, Slack, Workplace
or by a plain webhook.

These notifications are particularly useful because they provide real-time alerts, ensuring that any drifts are promptly addressed.
