### Overview

Atlas Cloud maintains always up-to-date, automatically generated documentation for your database schema.

### Why Schema Docs?

When working in a larger organization, having up-to-date documentation of the database schema
become increasingly important. Whether it's for onboarding new team members, or for streamlining
collaboration between different functions in the organization, having a single source of truth for the database schema
in a format that is easy to understand and navigate is crucial.

In addition, as a company matures, it is common to see some databases grow in complexity to a point where it becomes
difficult to keep track of all the tables, columns, and relationships. After many years of development and changes,
it is not uncommon to see databases with hundreds of tables and thousands of columns whose authors are no longer with
the company. In such cases, having a tool that can automatically generate and keep up-to-date the documentation of the
can bring clarity and understanding that is necessary for the organization to continue to grow and evolve.

### How it works

Schema Docs are regenerated whenever you push a new version of your schema to Atlas Cloud. It is therefore
recommended to set up your CI pipeline such that it pushes the schema to Atlas Cloud whenever changes are made to the
main branch of your project.
