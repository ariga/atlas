## Overview

With pre-migration checks, you can provide a list of assertions to make on the target database
before starting a migration. This can greatly reduce the failure rate of migrations by catching
issues early.

## Why use pre-migration checks?

Atlas provides a [comprehensive set of safety checks](/lint/analyzers) that can be made against migrations during the
Continuous Integration (CI) process.

However, some issues can only be classified as "might fail" during the CI process because they depend on the
actual state of the target database. For example, a migration might fail when you're adding a uniqueness
constraint to a column that already contains duplicate values. Alternatively, you might decide that you only
want to delete a column if it doesn't contain data.

## How it works

To add these checks, Atlas supports a text-based file archive to describe "migration plans". Unlike regular migration files,
which mainly contain a list of DDL statements (with optional directives), Atlas `txtar` files (currently) support two file
types: migration files and pre-execution check files.

The code below presents a simple example of a pre-migration check. The default checks file is named `checks.sql`,
and the `migration.sql` file contains the actual DDLs to be executed on the database in case the assertions are passed.

```sql title="20240201131900_drop_users.sql"
-- atlas:txtar

// highlight-next-line
-- checks.sql --
-- The assertion below must be evaluated to true. Hence, the "users" table must not contain any rows.
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);

// highlight-next-line
-- migration.sql --
-- The statement below will be executed only if the assertion above evaluates to true.
DROP TABLE users;
```

If the pre-execution checks pass, the migration will be applied and Atlas will report the results.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```

```applylog title="Output"
Migrating to version 20240201131900 from 20240201131800 (1 migrations in total):
// highlight-start
  -- checks before migrating version 20240201131900
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);
  -- ok (624.004Âµs)
// highlight-end
  -- migrating version 20240201131900
    -> DROP TABLE users;
  -- ok (5.412737ms)
  -------------------------
  -- 22.138088ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 check
  -- 1 sql statement
```

If the pre-execution checks fail, the migration will not be applied, and Atlas will exit with an error.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```
