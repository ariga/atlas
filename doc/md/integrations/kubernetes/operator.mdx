## What are Kubernetes Operators?

Kubernetes is an excellent solution for managing stateless resources. But for many stateful resources, such as databases,
reconciling the desired state of a database with its actual state can be a complex task that requires specific domain
knowledge. [Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
were introduced to the Kubernetes ecosystem to help users manage complex stateful resources by codifying
this domain knowledge into a Kubernetes controller.

## What is the Atlas Kubernetes Operator?

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator is a Kubernetes controller that uses Atlas to manage
your database schema. The Atlas Kubernetes Operator allows you to define the desired schema 
and apply it to your database using the Kubernetes API.

## Supported workflows

* [Declarative schema migrations](#declarative-schema-migrations)
* [Versioned schema migrations](#versioned-schema-migrations)

### Declarative schema migrations

![](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/k8s/operator/declarative-workflow.png)

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator supports [declarative migrations](/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#declarative-migrations).
In declarative migrations, the desired state of the database is defined by the user and the operator is responsible
for reconciling the desired state with the actual state of the database (planning and executing `CREATE`, `ALTER`
and `DROP` statements).

In this workflow, after installing the Atlas Kubernetes Operator, the user defines the desired state of the database
as an `AtlasSchema` resource which either includes the desired schema directly or references a `ConfigMap` that contains
it.

The operator then reconciles the desired state with the actual state of the database by planning and executing
`CREATE`, `ALTER` and `DROP` statements.

To ensure that the operator does not accidentally introduce destructive changes to the database, the user can
specify linting or diffing policies that will be applied to the computed plan before it is applied to the database.

To learn more about getting started with the Atlas Operator and declarative migrations, see the
[announcement blog post](/blog/2023/05/08/atlas-v011-kubernetes-operator).

### Versioned schema migrations

![](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/k8s/operator/versioned-flow.png)

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator also supports [versioned migrations](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#versioned-migrations).
In versioned migrations, the database schema is defined by a series of SQL scripts ("migrations") that are applied
in lexicographical order. The user can specify the version and migration directory to run, which can be located
on the [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.io/cloud/getting-started) or stored as a `ConfigMap` in your Kubernetes
cluster.

In this workflow, after installing the Atlas Kubernetes Operator, the user defines the desired state of the database
as an `AtlasMigration` resource which connects between a target database and a migration directory. The migration directory
may be configured as a remote directory in [Atlas Cloud](/cloud/directories) or as a `ConfigMap` in your Kubernetes
cluster.

The operator then reconciles the desired state with the actual state of the database by applying any pending migrations on the
target database.

## Installation

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator is available as a Helm Chart. To install the chart with the release name `atlas-operator`:

```bash
helm install atlas-operator oci://ghcr.io/ariga/charts/atlas-operator --namespace atlas-operator --create-namespace
```

## Providing credentials

### URLs

In order to manage the schema of your database, you must provide the Atlas Kubernetes Operator with an [Atlas URL](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/url)
to your database. The Atlas Kubernetes Operator will use this URL to connect to your database and apply changes to the schema.
As this string usually contains sensitive information, we recommend storing it as a [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Both `AtlasSchema` and `AtlasMigration` resources support defining the connection URL as a string (using the `url` field)
or as a reference to a Kubernetes secret (using the `urlFrom` field):

:::tip

If you are connecting to a database that is running in your Kubernetes cluster, note that you should
you use a namespace-qualified DNS name to connect to it. Connections are made from the Atlas Kubernetes Operator's
namespace, so you should use a DNS name that is resolvable from that namespace. For example, to connect to the `mysql`
service in the `app` namespace use:

```
mysql://user:pass@mysql.app:3306/myapp
```

:::

#### Schema and database bound URLs

Notice that depending on your use-case, you may want to use either a schema-bound or a database-bound connection.
* Schema-bound connections are recommended for most use-cases, as they allow you to manage the schema of a database
schema (named database). This is akin to selecting a specific database using a `USE` statement.
* Database-bound connections are recommended for use-cases where you want to manage multiple schemas in a single database
  at once.

Create a file named `db-credentials.yaml` with the following contents:

<Tabs
defaultValue="mysql-schema"
values={[
    {label: 'MySQL (Schema-bound)', value: 'mysql-schema'},
    {label: 'MySQL (DB-bound)', value: 'mysql-db'},
    {label: 'PostgreSQL (Schema-bound)', value: 'postgres-schema'},
    {label: 'PostgreSQL (DB-bound)', value: 'postgres-db'},
]}>
<TabItem value="mysql-schema">

```yaml title="db-credentials.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  url: "mysql://user:pass@your.db.dns.default:3306/myapp"
```
This defines a schema-bound connection to a named database called `myapp`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql-db">

```yaml title="db-credentials.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  url: "mysql://user:pass@your.db.com:3306/"
```
This defines a database-bound connection.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgres-schema">

```yaml title="db-credentials.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pg-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  url: "postgres://user:pass@your.db.com:5432/?search_path=myapp&sslmode=disable"
```
This defines a schema-bound connection to a schema called `myapp` to the default database (usually `postgres`).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgres-db">

```yaml title="db-credentials.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pg-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  url: "postgres://user:pass@your.db.com:5432/?sslmode=disable"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `urlFrom` {#credentials-url-from}

The `urlFrom` field is used to load the URL of the target database from another resource such as a
Kubernetes secret.

```yaml
urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: mysql-credentials
```

### `url` {#credentials-url}

The `url` field is used to define the URL of the target database directly. This is not recommended, but may
be useful for testing purposes.

```yaml
url: "mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/myapp"
```

### `credentials` object {#credentials-object}

Alternatively, you can provide the credentials for your database as a `credentials` object.

```yaml
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasSchema
metadata:
  name: atlasschema-postgres
spec:
  credentials:
    scheme: postgres
    host: postgres.default
    user: root
    passwordFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: password
        name: postgres-credentials
    database: postgres
    port: 5432
    parameters:
      sslmode: disable
  # ... rest of the resource
```

## Declarative migrations

The Atlas Operator relies on a Kubernetes custom resource called `AtlasSchema` to define the desired schema of your database.
You can find the full definition for this resource on the [ariga/atlas-operator repo](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-operator/blob/master/charts/atlas-operator/templates/crds/crd.yaml).
This resource describes the desired state of a target database that is used in the operator's reconciliation loop.

Let's review an example of such as a resource. Create a file named `atlas-schema.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml title="atlas-schema.yaml"
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasSchema
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  # Load the URL of the target database from a Kubernetes secret.
  urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: mysql-credentials
  # Define the desired schema of the target database. This can be defined in either
  # plain SQL like this example or in Atlas HCL.
  schema:
    sql: |
      create table users (
        id int not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(255) not null,
        email varchar(255) unique not null,
        short_bio varchar(255) not null,
        primary key (id)
      );
  # Define policies that control how the operator will apply changes to the target database.
  policy:
    # Define a policy that will stop the reconciliation loop if the operator detects
    # a destructive change such as dropping a column or table.
    lint:
      destructive:
        error: true
    # Define a policy that omits DROP COLUMN changes from any produced plan.
    diff:
      skip:
        drop_column: true
  # Exclude a table from being managed by the operator. This is useful for resources
  # that belong to other applications and are managed in other ways.
  exclude:
    - external_table_managed_elsewhere
```

Alternatively, you can use a `ConfigMap` to store the desired schema of your database. To use
this approach, create a ConfigMap with the desired schema:

```yaml title="atlas-schema-configmap.yaml"
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mysql-schema
data:
  schema.sql: |
    create table users (
       id int not null auto_increment,
       name varchar(255) not null,
       email varchar(255) unique not null,
       short_bio varchar(255) not null,
       primary key (id)
    );
```

Then, update the `AtlasSchema` resource to reference the config map key:

```yaml title="atlas-schema.yaml" {7-9}
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasSchema
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  schema:
    configMapKeyRef:
      key: schema.sql
      name: mysql-schema
  # Skipping all other fields for brevity.
```

:::warning Overlapping schemas on a single database

A word of caution: if you have multiple `AtlasSchema` resources that target the same database, you should
ensure that the schemas defined in each resource do not overlap. Otherwise, the operator may produce
unexpected results when attempting to reconcile the state of the database.

:::

## `AtlasSchema` API reference

The `AtlasSchema` resource is used to define the desired state of a target database.

Available fields:

### Providing credentials

See [`urlFrom`](#credentials-url-from), [`url`](#credentials-url) or [`credentials`](#credentials-object).

### `schema`

The `schema` field is used to define the desired schema of the target database.

This can be defined in either plain SQL or in Atlas HCL.

```yaml
schema:
    sql: |
      create table users (
        id int not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(255) not null,
        email varchar(255) uniuse
      );
```

```yaml
schema:
  hcl: |
    schema "myapp" {
    }
    table "users" {
      column "id" {
        type = int
      }
      // ...
    }
```

Alternatively, you can reference a key in a `ConfigMap` to store the desired schema of your database:

```
schema:
  configMapKeyRef:
    key: schema.sql
    name: mysql-schema
```

Note: the `.sql` suffix on the key denotes that the schema is defined in plain SQL. If you are using Atlas HCL,
you should use the `.hcl` suffix instead.

### `policy`

The `policy` field is used to define policies that control how the operator will apply changes to the target database.

#### `lint`

The `lint` field is used to define policies that control how the operator will lint the desired schema.

```yaml
policy:
  lint:
    destructive:
      error: true
```

Currently, the only lint policy available is `destructive`. This policy controls what the operator will do if it
detects a destructive change such as dropping a column or table.

#### `diff`

The `diff` field is used to define the diff policies that are used to plan the schema changes.

```yaml
policy:
  diff:
   skip:
    drop_column: true
```

Currently, the only diff policy available is `skip`. This policy controls which kind of schema changes will be
skipped from the produced plan. The following options are available:
* `add_column`, `add_foreign_key`, `add_index`, `add_schema`, `add_table`, `drop_column`, `drop_foreign_key`,
  `drop_index`, `drop_schema`, `drop_table`, `modify_column`, `modify_foreign_key`, `modify_index`,
  `modify_schema`, `modify_table`

### `exclude`

The `exclude` field is used to define tables that should be excluded from being managed by the operator.
This is useful for resources that belong to other applications and are managed in other ways.

```yaml
exclude:
- external_table_managed_elsewhere
```

### `schemas`

The `schemas` field is used to define schemas that should be managed by the operator. This is used
to manage multiple schemas in a single database and works only if the connection string is database-bound.

```yaml
schemas:
- schema1
- schema2
```

### `devURL`

Atlas relies on a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) to normalize schemas and make various
calculations. By default, the operator will spin a new database pod to use as the Dev Database.
However, if you have special requirements (such as have it preloaded with certain extensions or configuration),
you can use the `devURL` field to specify a [URL](/concepts/url) to use as the Dev Database.

```yaml
devURL: mysql://root:password@dev-db-svc.default:3306/dev
```

### `devURLFrom`

Alternatively, you can use the `devURLFrom` field to specify a key in a `Secret` that contains the Dev Database URL.

```yaml
devURLFrom:
  secretKeyRef:
    key: dev-url
    name: myapp
```


## Versioned migrations

### ConfigMap

The Atlas Operator supports defining the migration directory as `ConfigMap`
with key-value pairs where the key is the file name and the value is the content of the migration file.

```yaml title="atlas-migration-configmap.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: migration-dir
data:
  20230316085611.sql: |
    create table users (
      id int not null auto_increment,
      name varchar(255) not null,
      email varchar(255) unique not null,
      short_bio varchar(255) not null,
      primary key (id)
    );
  atlas.sum: |
    h1:W/ujmfqFLOAFDscMEVJ2wrbh4MrpVHENKEP9bVH3mlc=
    20230316085611.sql h1:Bb6K2XoJavRLhMIsITnxtWLiBhe/Dfp5X5yNxBYP++I=
```

Then, update the `AtlasMigration` resource to reference the config map key:

```yaml title="atlas-migration.yaml"
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasMigration
metadata:
  name: atlasmigration-sample
spec:
  urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: db-credentials
  dir:
    configMapRef:
      name: "migration-dir" # ConfigMap name of atlas-migration-configmap.yaml
```

### Remote Directory (Atlas Cloud)

If your migration directory is connected to [Atlas Cloud](/cloud/directories/)
you can configure the operator to read it from your cloud account.

To configure your `AtlasMigration` to read the directory from your cloud account, set the `cloud` and `dir`
attributes.

```yaml title="atlas-migration-dir.yaml"
apiVersion: db.atlasgo.io/v1alpha1
kind: AtlasMigration
metadata:
  name: atlasmigration-sample
spec:
  urlFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: url
      name: db-credentials
  cloud:
    project: "cloud" # Atlas Cloud project name
    tokenFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        key: token
        name: atlas-credentials
  dir:
    remote:
      name: "atlas" # Migration directory name in your atlas cloud project
      tag: "commit-id" # When tag is not specified, the latest tag will be used
```


## `AtlasMigration` API reference

### Providing credentials

See [`urlFrom`](#credentials-url-from), [`url`](#credentials-url) or [`credentials`](#credentials-object).

### `envName`

The `envName` sets the environment name used for reporting runs to Atlas Cloud.
By default, the environment name is set to `Kubernetes`.

```yaml
envName: "production"
```

### `cloud`

Cloud is used to define the Atlas Cloud configuration.

#### `project`

The `project` field is used to define the project name.

```yaml
cloud:
  project: "cloud"
```

#### `tokenFrom`

The `tokenFrom` field is used to load the Atlas Cloud token from another resource such as a Kubernetes secret.

```yaml
cloud:
  tokenFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: token
      name: atlas-credentials
```

### `dir`

The `dir` field is used to define the migration directory.
For a directory defined in a `ConfigMap`, use `configMapRef` to reference the `ConfigMap` that contains the migration files.

```yaml
dir:
  configMapRef:
    name: "migration-dir" # ConfigMap name of atlas-migration-configmap.yaml
```

For remote directory, use `remote` to define the migration directory in Atlas Cloud.

```yaml
dir:
  remote:
    name: "atlas"
    tag: "commit-id"
```

Alternatively, you can use the `local` field to define the migration directory inline in the `AtlasMigration` resource.

```yaml
dir:
  local:
    20230316085611.sql: |
      create table users (
        id int not null auto_increment,
        name varchar(255) not null,
        email varchar(255) unique not null,
        short_bio varchar(255) not null,
        primary key (id)
      );
    atlas.sum: |
      h1:W/ujmfqFLOAFDscMEVJ2wrbh4MrpVHENKEP9bVH3mlc=
      20230316085611.sql h1:Bb6K2XoJavRLhMIsITnxtWLiBhe/Dfp5X5yNxBYP++I=
```

### `revisionsSchema`

The `revisionsSchema` field is used to define the schema name for the revisions table.
Details about the revisions table can be found in the [Revisions Schema](/versioned/apply#schema-revision-information).

```yaml
revisionsSchema: "atlas"
```
