### What are Kubernetes Operators?

For many stateful resources, reconciling the desired state of a database with its actual state
can be a complex task that requires a lot of domain knowledge. [Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
were introduced to the Kubernetes ecosystem to help users manage complex stateful resources by codifying
this domain knowledge into a Kubernetes controller.

### What is the Atlas Kubernetes Operator?

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator is a Kubernetes controller that uses Atlas to manage
your database schema. The Atlas Kubernetes Operator allows you to define the desired schema 
and apply it to your database using the Kubernetes API.

### Supported workflows

* [Declarative schema migrations](#declarative-schema-migrations)
* [Versioned schema migrations](#versioned-schema-migrations)

### Declarative schema migrations

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator supports [declarative migrations](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#declarative-migrations).
In declarative migrations, the desired state of the database is defined by the user and the operator is responsible
for reconciling the desired state with the actual state of the database (planning and executing `CREATE`, `ALTER`
and `DROP` statements).

### Versioned schema migrations

The Atlas Kubernetes Operator supports [versioned migrations](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#versioned-migrations).
In versioned migrations, the database schema is defined by a series of migrations that are applied in order. The user can specify the version
and migration directory to run, which can be located on the [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.io/cloud/getting-started) or the local file system.
