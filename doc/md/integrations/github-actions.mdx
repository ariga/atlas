[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a popular CI/CD 
product from GitHub. With GitHub Actions, users can easily define workflows
that are triggered in various lifecycle events related to a Git repository.
For example, many teams configure GitHub actions to run all unit tests in
a repository on each change that is committed to a repository. 

One of the powerful features of GitHub Actions is its extensibility: it is
very easy to package a piece of functionality as a module (called an "action")
that can later be re-used by many projects. 

## CI for database schema changes

Teams using GitHub that wish to ensure all changes to their database schema are safe
can use the [`atlas-action`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action) GitHub Action.

This action is used for [linting migration directories](/versioned/lint)
using the `atlas migrate lint` command. This command  validates and analyzes the contents
of migration directories and generates insights and diagnostics on the selected changes:

* Ensure the migration history can be replayed from any point at time.
* Protect from unexpected history changes when concurrent migrations are written to the migration directory by
  multiple team members. Read more about the consistency checks in the section below.
* Detect whether destructive or irreversible changes have been made or whether they are dependent on tables'  
  contents and can cause a migration failure.

### Supported directory formats

This action supports analyzing migration directories in formats
accepted by different schema migration tools:
* [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io)
* [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
* [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)
* [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate)

### Usage

Add `.github/workflows/atlas-ci.yaml` to your repo with the following contents:
<Tabs
defaultValue="mysql"
values={[
    {label: 'MySQL', value: 'mysql'},
    {label: 'MariaDB', value: 'maria'},
    {label: 'PostgreSQL', value: 'postgres'},
]}>
<TabItem value="mysql">

### Configuration

Configure the action by passing input parameters in the `with:` block.

#### `dir`

Sets the directory that contains the migration scripts to analyze.

#### `dir-format`

Sets the format of the migration directory. Options: `atlas` (default),
`golang-migrate`, `goose` or `dbmate`. Coming soon: `flyway`, `liquibase`.

#### `dev-url`

The URL of the dev-database to use for analysis.

* Read about [Atlas URL formats](/concepts/url)
* Read about [dev-databases](/concepts/dev-database)

#### `latest`

Use the `latest` mode to decide which files to analyze. By default,
Atlas will use `git-base` to analyze any files that are present in the
diff between the base branch and the current.

Unless this option is set, the base branch (`master`/`main`/etc) must
be checked out locally or you will see an error such as:
```
Atlas failed with code 1: Error: git diff: exit status 128
```

The full list of input options can be found in [action.yml](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action/blob/master/action.yml).
