[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a popular CI/CD 
product from GitHub. With GitHub Actions, users can easily define workflows
that are triggered in various lifecycle events related to a Git repository.
For example, many teams configure GitHub actions to run all unit tests in
a repository on each change that is committed to a repository. 

One of the powerful features of GitHub Actions is its extensibility: it is
very easy to package a piece of functionality as a module (called an "action")
that can later be re-used by many projects. 

Atlas provides a number of GitHub Actions that can be used to automate
database schema management tasks.

| Action                                                | Use Case                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [ariga/atlas-action](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action)        | CI for schema changes                               |
| [ariga/atlas-sync-action](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-sync-action)   | Sync your migration directory to Atlas Cloud (atlasgo.cloud) |
| [ariga/atlas-deploy-action](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-deploy-action) | Deploy versioned migrations from GitHub Actions    |


## `ariga/atlas-action` (CI)

Teams using GitHub that wish to ensure all changes to their database schema are safe
can use the [`atlas-action`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action) GitHub Action.

This action is used for [linting migration directories](/versioned/lint)
using the `atlas migrate lint` command. This command  validates and analyzes the contents
of migration directories and generates insights and diagnostics on the selected changes:

* Ensure the migration history can be replayed from any point at time.
* Protect from unexpected history changes when concurrent migrations are written to the migration directory by
  multiple team members. Read more about the consistency checks in the section below.
* Detect whether destructive or irreversible changes have been made or whether they are dependent on tables'  
  contents and can cause a migration failure.

### Supported directory formats

This action supports analyzing migration directories in formats
accepted by different schema migration tools:
* [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io)
* [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
* [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)
* [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate)
* [Liquibase](https://liquibase.org)
* [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org)

### Usage

### Configuration

Configure the action by passing input parameters in the `with:` block.

#### `dir`

Sets the directory that contains the migration scripts to analyze.

#### `dir-format`

Sets the format of the migration directory. Options: `atlas` (default),
`golang-migrate`, `goose` or `dbmate`, `flyway`, `liquibase`.

#### `dev-url`

The URL of the dev-database to use for analysis.

* Read about [Atlas URL formats](/concepts/url)
* Read about [dev-databases](/concepts/dev-database)

#### `latest`

Use the `latest` mode to decide which files to analyze. By default,
Atlas will use `git-base` to analyze any files that are present in the
diff between the base branch and the current.

Unless this option is set, the base branch (`master`/`main`/etc) must
be checked out locally or you will see an error such as:
```
Atlas failed with code 1: Error: git diff: exit status 128
```

The full list of input options can be found in [action.yml](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-action/blob/master/action.yml).

## `ariga/atlas-deploy-action`

You can use [ariga/atlas-deploy-action](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-deploy-action) to deploy migrations to your database directly from
GitHub Actions.

:::info

Atlas needs network access to your database to deploy migrations,
so make sure your database is either publicly accessible or that you have otherwise enabled
network access to it from your GitHub Actions runners.

:::

This action supports two workflows:

- *Local* - the migration directory is checked in to the repository.
- *Cloud* - the migration directory is [connected to Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.io/cloud/directories).
Runs are reported to your Atlas Cloud account.

### Examples


Notice that the following examples rely on a `DATABASE_URL` secret being set in your repository.

To learn how to set secrets, read [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

The `DATABASE_URL` secret should be set to the URL of your database, for examples please see [Atlas URL formats](/concepts/url).

#### Local

```yaml
name: Deploy Database Migrations
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy Atlas Migrations
        uses: ariga/atlas-deploy-action@v0
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
          dir: path/to/migrations
```

#### Deploy from Cloud

```yaml
name: Deploy Database Migrations
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy Atlas Migrations
        uses: ariga/atlas-deploy-action@v0
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
          cloud-token: ${{ secrets.ATLAS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
          cloud-dir: hello # replace with your directory name
```

### Reference

#### Inputs

- `url`: URL to target database (should be passed as a secret). (Required)
- `dir`: Local path of the migration directory in the repository. (Optional)
- `cloud-token`: Token for using Atlas Cloud (should be passed as a secret). (Optional)
- `cloud-dir`: Name of the migration directory in the cloud. (Must be set if `cloud-token` is set)
- `cloud-tag`: Tag of the migration version in the cloud. (Optional)

Note: Either `dir` or `cloud-dir` must be set. If both are provided, an error will be thrown.

#### Outputs

- `error`: Error message if any.
- `current`: Current migration version.
- `target`: Target migration version.
- `pending_count`: Number of pending migrations.
- `applied_count`: Number of applied migrations.

## `ariga/atlas-sync-action`

You can use [ariga/atlas-sync-action](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-sync-action) to sync your
migration directory from your GitHub repository to [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud).

Use this action in your workflow to sync your migration directory to Atlas Cloud.
It is highly recommended that you only run this action on the main branch of your repository,
as its purpose is to persist the desired state of your migration directory.

To use this action, you must first have a Bot Token with permissions to write to your
account. To learn how to create tokens, read [Atlas Cloud Bots](/cloud/bots).

### Example

```yaml
name: Sync Atlas Migrations
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Only run on our main branch
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      # Spin up a mysql:8 container to be used as the dev-database for analysis.
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: pass
          MYSQL_DATABASE: test
        options: >-
          --health-cmd "mysqladmin ping -ppass"
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-start-period 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: ariga/atlas-sync-action@v0
        with:
          name: dir_name
          dir: path/to/migrations
          dev-url: 'mysql://root:pass@mysql:3306/dev'
          cloud-token: ${{ secrets.ATLAS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

### Reference

Configure this action with the following inputs:

#### `dir`

**Required** The path to the directory containing your migrations.

#### `driver`

**Required** The database driver to use. One of: `mysql`, `postgres`, `sqlite`.
