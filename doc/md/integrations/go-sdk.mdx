Atlas was meant to be used as a CLI tool. Despite being written in Go, it is targeted for the
engineering community at large, agnostic to which programming language you use in your project.
For this reason, the public API which the project commits to support is the CLI.

Having said that, Atlas is widely popular in the Go community and we want to make sure that
Go developers can easily integrate Atlas into their projects. To support these kind of integrations,
we provide a simple wrapper SDK called [`atlasexec`](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-go-sdk/tree/master/atlasexec) 
around the Atlas CLI which can be used to drive the CLI from Go code. This SDK is used by official 
integrations of Atlas, such as some [GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions), the [Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/kubernetes/operator),
and the [Terraform Provider](/integrations/terraform-provider).

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have the Atlas CLI installed:

<InstallationInstructions />

Next, add the `atlasexec` package to your Go project:

```bash
go get ariga.io/atlas-go-sdk/atlasexec
```

## Example

Let's create a dummy migration directory to demonstrate how to use the SDK:

```bash
mkdir atlasgosdk
cd atlasgosdk
```

Next, let's create a simple migration:

```bash
atlas migrate new --edit create_users
```

This will open an editor where you can type the migration code. Let's add a statement
that creates a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
A migration file along with an `atlas.sum` file will be created in the current directory:

```
.
└── migrations
    ├── 20230815103743_create_users.sql
    └── atlas.sum

1 directory, 2 files
```


Now, you can use the `atlasexec` package to drive the CLI from Go code, create a new file named `main.go` with the following content:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"ariga.io/atlas-go-sdk/atlasexec"
)

func main() {
	// Define the execution context, supplying a migration directory
	// and potentially an `atlas.hcl` configuration file using `atlasexec.WithHCL`.
	workdir, err := atlasexec.NewWorkingDir(
		atlasexec.WithMigrations(
			os.DirFS("./migrations"),
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to load working directory: %v", err)
	}
	// atlasexec works on a temporary directory, so we need to close it
	defer workdir.Close()

	// Initialize the client.
	client, err := atlasexec.NewClientWithDir(workdir.Path(), "atlas")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to initialize client: %v", err)
	}
	// Run `atlas migrate apply` on a SQLite database under /tmp.
	res, err := client.MigrateApply(context.Background(), &atlasexec.MigrateApplyParams{
		URL: "sqlite:///tmp/demo.db?_fk=1&cache=shared",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to apply migrations: %v", err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Applied %d migrations\n", len(res.Applied))
}
```

Now, run the program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Observe the output:

```bash
Applied 1 migrations
```

You can also run the program again and observe that no migrations are applied:

```bash
Applied 0 migrations
```

## Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we have seen how to use the `atlasexec` package to drive the Atlas CLI from Go code.
We focused on the `Apply` method, but the SDK also provides methods for `SchemaApply`, `Status`, `Inspect`, and more.
For more information, please refer to the [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-go-sdk@master/atlasexec).
