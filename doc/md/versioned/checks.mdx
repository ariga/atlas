Atlas supports the concept of pre-migration checks, where each migration version can include a list of assertions
(predicates) that must evaluate to true before the migration is applied.
For example, before dropping a table, we aim to ensure that no data is deleted and the table must be empty, or we check
for the absence of duplicate values before adding a unique index to a table.

:::info Cloud Directory
Pre-migration checks only work for migration directories in the [Atlas Schema Registry](/cloud/features/registry). Check out the
[introduction guide](/versioned/intro#pushing-migrations-to-atlas) to get started with Atlas Cloud.

### `atlas:txtar` directive

Atlas supports a text-based file archive to describe "migration plans". Unlike regular migration files, which mainly
contain a list of DDL statements (with optional directives), Atlas `txtar` files (currently) support two file
types: migration files and pre-execution check files. For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem default value="one-checks" label="One check file">

The code below presents the most standard example of pre-migration checks. The default checks file is named `checks.sql`,
and the `migration.sql` file contains the actual DDLs to be executed on the database in case the assertions are passed.

```sql title="20240201131900_drop_users.sql"
-- atlas:txtar

// highlight-next-line
-- checks.sql --
-- The assertion below must be evaluated to true. Hence, table users must be empty.
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);

// highlight-next-line
-- migration.sql --
-- The statement below will be executed only if the assertion above is evaluated to true.
DROP TABLE users;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem default value="multi-checks" label="Multiple check files">

The example below presents a case where an archive file includes two check files:

- `checks/users.sql` - The default policy for check files dictates that all assertions must be evaluated to true.
- `checks/roles.sql` - This check file utilizes the `atlas:assert oneof` directive, indicating that at least one of
   the assertions must be evaluated to true.

```sql title="20240201131900_drop_users.sql"
-- atlas:txtar

// highlight-next-line
-- checks/users.sql --
-- All assertions below must be evaluated to true. The tables mentioned below must be empty.
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM internal_users);
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM external_users);

// highlight-next-line
-- checks/roles.sql --
-- atlas:assert oneof

-- At least one of the assertions below must be evaluated to true. Hence, we drop
-- the "roles" table only if it is empty, or there are no associations to it.
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM roles);
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM user_roles);

// highlight-next-line
-- migration.sql --
-- The statements below will be executed only if the check files above are passed.
DROP TABLE internal_users;
DROP TABLE external_users;
DROP TABLE roles;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note <a href="#file-directive" id="file-directive">File directives</a>
File directives, like `atlas:txtar` are located at the top of the migration file and should not be associated with any
statement. Therefore, double new lines (`\n\n`) are used to separate file directives from its content.

### Examples

Executing the migration examples defined above will result in the following output:

#### Pre-execution checks passed

If the pre-execution checks pass, the migration will be applied, and Atlas will report the results.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```

![Check passed](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/cloud/deploy/check-passed.png)

```applylog title="Output"
Migrating to version 20240201131900 from 20240201131800 (1 migrations in total):

// highlight-start
  -- checks before migrating version 20240201131900
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);
  -- ok (624.004Âµs)
// highlight-end

  -- migrating version 20240201131900
    -> DROP TABLE users;
  -- ok (5.412737ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 22.138088ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 check
  -- 1 sql statement
```

#### Pre-execution checks failed

If the pre-execution checks fail, the migration will not be applied, and Atlas will exit with an error.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```

![Check failed](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/cloud/deploy/check-failed.png)

```applylog title="Output"
