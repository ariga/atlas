##  Atlas is Open-Core

Atlas is an open-core project. The core engine is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ariga/atlas)
under the Apache 2.0 license. Open-source features cover the core functionality of Atlas, including database inspection,
diffing, migration planning and execution, and more. For the basic and common use cases, the open-source version of
Atlas is more than enough.

In addition, Atlas also offers a number of advanced features that are only available in proprietary versions. The
vast majority of these features are available in the Free Plan of Atlas, which you can use for free by creating
an Atlas account. The Free Plan has some limitations, but those pertain mostly to the number of projects you can
use in [Atlas Cloud](https://atlasgo.cloud).

### Free Plan

The Free Plan is available to all Atlas users. Create your Atlas Free Plan account by running the following command
and following the instructions on the screen:

```bash
atlas login
```

## Feature Availability

This document compares the CLI features available to users who are logged in to Atlas Cloud and those who are not.
