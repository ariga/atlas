[Atlas Pro](/pricing) is a paid plan that offers advanced features on top of the features that are openly available
to everyone.  Although we try to make the price point for end users affordable, we understand that some users may not
be able to afford the cost of the Pro Plan.

As a way of saying thanks to our community and to enable Atlas Pro to be used in scenarios where a budget for software
is not available, we have created the **Atlas Pro Hacker License**.  This license allows you to use the Pro Plan for free
in specific scenarios.

### Who can apply for the Hacker License?

Here are the three categories of users who can apply for the Hacker License:

1. *You are a Student*

   To qualify as a student, applicants must be currently enrolled in an accredited educational institution (e.g.,
   university, college, or vocational school) and able to provide a valid student ID or enrollment verification.

2. *You are an Open Source Maintainer*

   To qualify as an OSS maintainer, applicants must be actively maintaining or contributing to a widely available
   open-source project, with the project being publicly accessible and under an approved open-source license.

3. *You are working on a Hobby or Personal Project*

   To qualify as a hobbyist or indie hacker, applicants must be working on a personal, non-commercial project
   independently or in a small team, without the backing of a formal organization or commercial venture.

Please be aware that the Hacker License is not intended for commercial use.  If you are using Atlas Pro in a commercial
setting, we ask that you consider supporting the project by purchasing a Pro Plan subscription.
