The `atlas migrate test` command allows you to write tests for your schema migrations. This feature
enables you to test logic in your migrations in a minimal and straightforward way. The command is similar to
[`atlas schema test`](/testing/schema) but is focused on testing schema migrations.

:::info Login Required
Migrations testing works only for logged-in users, free and paid. Use the following command to use this feature:

```shell
atlas login
```

### Introduction

Atlas migrations testing is inspired by the popular databases in the way they test their public (and private) APIs. The structure
is defined in HCL files (suffixed with a `.test.hcl`), but the underlying testing logic is written in plain SQL. The
following document describes the different structure options, flags, and capabilities supported by the testing framework.

#### Flags

* `--dir` the URL to the migration directory, by default it is `file://migrations`.
* `--dev-url` - a [URL](/concepts/url) to the [_Dev-Database_](../concepts/dev.mdx) to run the tests on.
* `--run` (optional) - run only tests matching the given regexp.

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dir" label="Test Directories">

```shell
atlas migrate test --dev-url "docker://postgres/15/dev" .
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="file" label="Test Files">

```shell
atlas migrate test --env local migrate.test.hcl
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### The `test "migrate"` block

The `test "migrate" "<name>"` block describes a test case. The second label defines the test case name, and the following
arguments are supported:

- `skip` (bool) - indicates whether the test case should be executed or skipped (can be computed). Defaults to `false`.

Every test case starts with the zero state of the migration directory, and calls to the `migrate` command
blocks migrate it to the specified version. At the end of the execution, Atlas cleans up the dev-database and prepares
it for the next test case, regardless of the test result.

#### Example

```hcl
test "migrate" "20240613061102" {
  # Migrate to version 20240613061046.
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  # Insert some test data.
  exec {
    sql = "insert into users (name) values ('Ada Lovelace')"
  }
  # Migrate to version 20240613061102.
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061102"
  }
  # Verify the correctness of the data migration.
  exec {
    sql = "select first_name,last_name from users"
    output = "Ada, Lovelace"
  }
}
```
:::info
* Unlike [schema test](/testing/schema) cases, migration tests cannot be run in parallel.
* The `skip` argument or the `--run` flag can be used to test only migrations that are relevant to the current
  development. For example, testing only the latest migration.
:::

A test case is composed of zero or more commands that are executed in order, and it is aborted if any of the commands fail.
The supported commands are:

### `migrate` command

The `migrate` command expects a migration version to migrate to. The strategy for testing a specific version is to
migrate to the version before it, insert test data, migrate to the tested version to ensure it passes, and then run
assertions to verify its correctness.

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
test "migrate" "20240613061102" {
  # Migrate to one version before the tested version.
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  # Insert some test data.
  exec {
    sql = "insert into users (name) values ('Ada Lovelace')"
  }
  # Migrate to the tested version.
  migrate {
      to = "20240613061102"
  }
  # Verify the correctness of the data migration.
  exec {
    sql = "select first_name,last_name from users"
    output = "Ada, Lovelace"
  }
}
```

### `exec` command

The `exec` command expects an SQL statement to pass. If `output` or `match` is defined, the output of the SQL statement
is compared to the expected value.

* `sql` (string) - the SQL statement to execute.
* `format` (optional) - the format of the output (default: `csv`). Can be `table` or `csv`.
* `output` (optional) - the expected output of the SQL statement.
* `match` (optional) - a regular expression to match the output of the SQL statement.

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
test "migrate" "20240613061046" {
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  # Expected exec to pass.
  exec {
    sql = <<SQL
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 'one');
INSERT INTO t VALUES (2, 'two');
SQL
  }
  # Expected exec to pass and output
  # be equal to the expected table.
  exec {
    sql = "SELECT a, b FROM t;"
    format = table
    output = <<TAB
 a |  b
---+-----
 1 | one
 2 | two
TAB
  }
}
```

### `catch` command

The `catch` command expects an SQL statement to fail. If `error` is defined, the error message is compared to the expected
value.

* `sql` (string) - the SQL statement to execute.
* `error` (optional) - matches the error message.

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
test "migrate" "20240613061046" {
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  catch {
    sql   = "SELECT 1+"
    error = "incomplete input"
  }
}
```

### `assert` command

The `assert` command expects an SQL statement to pass and the output to be a single row (+column) with a true value.

* `sql` (string) - the SQL statement to execute.
* `error_message` (optional) - the error message to display if the assertion fails.

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
test "migrate" "20240613061046" {
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  assert {
    sql = "SELECT json_valid('{')"
    error_message = "expects a valid JSON"
  }
}
```

### `log` command

The `log` command logs a message to the test output. It can be useful to report the progress of the test case.

* `message` (string) - the message to log.

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
test "migrate" "20240613061046" {
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  log {
    message = "Seeded the database"
  }
}
```

### Input Variables

Test files can be parameterized using variables, and their values can be set through the [`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects)
config file. For example, given this test file:

```hcl title="migrate.test.hcl"
variable "seed_file" {
  type = string
}

test "migrate" "seed" {
  migrate {
    to = "20240613061046"
  }
  exec {
    sql = "SELECT seed('${var.seed_file}')"
  }
}
```

Test config can be defined on the `env` block (or globally) and executed using the `--env` flag:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "dev" {
  src = "<schema to test>"
  dev = "<docker-based dev-url>"

// highlight-start
  # Test configuration for local development.
  test {
    migrate {
      src = ["migrate.test.hcl"]
      vars = {
        seed_file = "filename.sql"
        variable2 = var.name
        variable3 = data.external.value
      }
    }
  }
// highlight-end
}
```

```
atlas migrate test --env dev
```

:::info Input Variables

[Input variables](../atlas-schema/input-variables) can be defined statically per environment, injected from the CLI using
the `--var` flag, or computed from a [data source](../atlas-schema/projects#data-sources).
