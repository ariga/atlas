Atlas features a Data Definition Language (DDL) that has an [HCL-syntax](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)
for defining the desired state of database schemas. In this section we will learn how to use the Atlas
CLI to inspect an existing database and write it's schema in HCL to a file. 

Inspection is done via the `atlas schema inspect` command. To learn about its parameters, run:
```shell
atlas schema inspect --help
```
View the output:
```text
Inspect an atlas schema

Usage:
  atlas schema inspect [flags]

Examples:

atlas schema inspect -d "mysql://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname"
atlas schema inspect -d "mariadb://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname"
atlas schema inspect --dsn "postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname?sslmode=disable"
atlas schema inspect -d "sqlite://file:ex1.db?_fk=1"

Flags:
  -d, --dsn string   [driver://username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value] Select data source using the dsn format
  -h, --help         help for inspect
  -w, --web          open in UI server
```

If you're using PostgreSQL, there is [additional documentation about building the connection string](../dsn#ssltls-mode)

### Inspecting our database

To inspect our locally-running MySQL instance from the [previous](01-introduction.mdx) section,
use the `-d` flag and write output to a file named `atlas.hcl`:
```shell
atlas schema inspect -d "mysql://root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/example" > atlas.hcl
```
To view the contents of the created file:
```shell
cat atlas.hcl
```
View the output:
```hcl
schema "example" {
  charset = "utf8mb4"
  collate = "utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci"
}
```
As you can see, Atlas inspected our (empty) database and wrote an Atlas HCL document 
containing only a [Schema](../ddl/sql.mdx#schema) resource.

Next, let's create some tables in our SQL database and see how they are reflected
in the inspected Atlas HCL document. 

### Modifying our database schema manually

In our MySQL command-line prompt, let's create two tables:
```sql
CREATE table users (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(100)
);
CREATE TABLE blog_posts (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    title varchar(100),
    body text,
    author_id int,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
Observe that the tables are created successfully:
```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```
Our schema represents a highly simplified blogging system with a users
table for the authors and a blog_posts table for the contents:

### Inspecting table schemas with Atlas CLI

Next, let's re-run our inspection command:
```shell
atlas schema inspect -d "mysql://root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/example" > atlas.hcl
```
Browse through the updated contents of the file, it contains 3 blocks representing
our schema as before, and two new blocks representing the `users` and `blog_posts` tables.
Consider the following block:
```hcl
table "users" {
  schema = schema.example
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = int
  }
  column "name" {
    null = true
    type = varchar(100)
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
```
This block represents a [Table](../ddl/sql.mdx#table) resource with an `id`, and `name`
columns. The `schema` field references the `example` schema that is defined elsewhere
in this document. In addition, the `primary_key` sub-block defines the `id` column as 
the primary key for the table. In SQL databases, columns usually have a type attribute
that defines the kind of data that can be stored in that column. Atlas strives to 
mimic the syntax of the database that the user is working against. In this case, the
type for the `id` column is `int`, and `varchar(100)` for the `name` column. To
see the full list of supported types, [click here](../ddl/sql_types.md).


Next, consider this block:
```hcl
table "blog_posts" {
  schema = schema.example
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = int
  }
  column "title" {
    null = true
    type = varchar(100)
  }
  column "body" {
    null = true
    type = text
  }
  column "author_id" {
    null = true
    type = int
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
  foreign_key "blog_posts_ibfk_1" {
    columns     = [column.author_id]
    ref_columns = [table.users.column.id]
    on_update   = "NO ACTION"
    on_delete   = "NO ACTION"
  }
  index "author_id" {
    unique  = false
    columns = [column.author_id]
  }
}
```
This block represents the `blog_posts` table. In addition to the elements
we saw in the `users` table, here we can find a [Foreign Key](../ddl/sql.mdx#foreign-key)
block, declaring that the `author_id` column references the `id` column on the
`users` table.

To learn more about the resource types that are available to describe SQL schemas,
read the [SQL Syntax](../ddl/sql.mdx) documentation.

In the next section, we will see how we can modify our database's schema by 
applying a modified Atlas HCL file using the Atlas CLI.
