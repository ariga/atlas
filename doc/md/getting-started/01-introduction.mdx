### Introduction

Atlas CLI is an open-source tool designed to help software engineers, DBAs and DevOps
practitioners to manage their database schemas.  Atlas users can use the [Atlas DDL](../ddl/intro.md)
(Data-definition language), to describe the desired database schema and use the command-line
tool to plan and apply the migrations to their systems. 

In this guide, we will install the latest version of Atlas, and use it to manage
the schema of a local database that we will run inside a Docker container.

### Install the CLI

<Tabs
defaultValue="apple-intel-brew"
values={[
{label: 'macOS (Homebrew)', value: 'apple-intel-brew'},
{label: 'macOS (Plain)', value: 'apple-intel-plain'},

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="apple-intel-plain">

Download latest release.
```shell
curl -LO https://release.ariga.io/atlas/atlas-darwin-amd64-latest
```

Make the atlas binary executable.
```shell
chmod +x ./atlas-darwin-amd64-latest
```

Move the atlas binary to a file location on your system PATH.

:::info
Latest release is updated twice a day and is based on the most recent tagged release.
:::

Starting with release [v0.3.0](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/releases/tag/v0.3.0),
ֿthe distributed binaries include code for a [Management UI](../ui/intro.md) wrapping the
core Atlas engine that is not currently released publicly. The binaries
themselves are still released under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/blob/master/LICENSE).
If you would like to build Atlas from source without the UI follow the instructions [here](../cli/reference.md#building-from-source).

To verify that the CLI is installed correctly run:
```shell
atlas
```
You should see the help text describing the different Atlas sub-commands:
```
A database toolkit.

Usage:
  atlas [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  env         Print atlas env params
  help        Help about any command
  schema      Work with atlas schemas
  version     Show atlas CLI version

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for atlas

Use "atlas [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
### Start a Local Database Container

For the purpose of this guide, we will start a local Docker container running MySQL.

```shell
docker run --name atlas-db  -p 3306:3306  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=example   mysql:8.0.27
```

To verify the local database is running, run the MySQL command-line interface
from within the container:

```shell
docker  exec -it  atlas-db  mysql --password='pass' example
```
Run `show tables;` to verify that the database is empty:
```text
mysql> show tables;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
mysql>
```

In the next section, we will learn how to use the Atlas CLI to inspect the
schema of our running database.
