Atlas CLI is an open-source tool designed to help software engineers, DBAs and DevOps
practitioners to manage their database schemas.  Atlas users can use the [Atlas DDL](../atlas-schema/sql-resources)
(data-definition language) to describe the desired database schema and use the command-line
tool to plan and apply the migrations to their systems.

### Start a local database container

For the purpose of this guide, we will start a local Docker container running MySQL.

```shell
docker run --name atlas-db -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=example mysql
```
For this example, we will start off with the following database:
```sql
CREATE table users (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(100)
);
```
Our schema represents a `users` table, where each user has an ID and a name.

### Inspecting our database

Atlas features a Data Definition Language (DDL) that has an [HCL-syntax](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)
for defining the desired state of database schemas.

Inspection is done via the `atlas schema inspect` command.

To inspect our locally-running MySQL instance, use the `-u` flag and write the output to a file named `schema.hcl`:

```shell
atlas schema inspect -u "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/example" > schema.hcl
```

Open the `schema.hcl` file to view the Atlas schema that describes our database.

```hcl
table "users" {
  schema = schema.example
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = int
  }
  column "name" {
    null = true
    type = varchar(100)
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
```
This block represents a [table](../atlas-schema/sql.mdx#table) resource with `id`, and `name`
columns. The `schema` field references the `example` schema that is defined elsewhere
in this document. In addition, the `primary_key` sub-block defines the `id` column as
the primary key for the table. Atlas strives to mimic the syntax of the database that the user is working against. In this case, the
type for the `id` column is `int`, and `varchar(100)` for the `name` column.

Now, consider we want to add a `blog_posts` table and have our schema represent a simplified
blogging system.

![Blog ERD](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/images/blog-erd.png)

Let's add the following to `schema.hcl`:
```hcl
table "blog_posts" {
  schema = schema.example
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = int
  }
  column "title" {
    null = true
    type = varchar(100)
  }
  column "body" {
    null = true
    type = text
  }
  column "author_id" {
    null = true
    type = int
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
  foreign_key "author_fk" {
    columns     = [column.author_id]
    ref_columns = [table.users.column.id]
  }
  index "author_id" {
    unique  = false
    columns = [column.author_id]
  }
}
```
In addition to the elements we saw in the `users` table, here we can find a [foreign key](../atlas-schema/sql.mdx#foreign-key)
block, declaring that the `author_id` column references the `id` column on the
`users` table.

Now, let's apply these changes by running a migration.
In Atlas, migrations can be applied in two types of workflows: _declarative_ and _versioned_.

### Declarative Migrations
The declarative approach requires the user to define the _desired_ end schema, and Atlas provides
a safe way to alter the database to get there.

Let's see this in action.

Continuing the example, in order to apply the changes to our database we will run the `apply` command:

```shell
atlas schema apply \
  -u "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/example" \
  -f schema.hcl
```

Atlas presents the plan it created by displaying the SQL statements. For example, for a MySQL database we will see
the following:

```console
-- Planned Changes:
-- Create "blog_posts" table
// highlight-next-line-info
CREATE TABLE `example`.`blog_posts` (`id` int NOT NULL, `title` varchar(100) NULL, `body` text NULL, `author_id` int NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), INDEX `author_id` (`author_id`), CONSTRAINT `author_fk` FOREIGN KEY (`author_id`) REFERENCES `example`.`users` (`id`))
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Are you sure?:
  ▸ Apply
    Abort
```
Apply the changes, and that's it! You have successfully run a declarative migration.

You can reinspect the database by running the `inspect` command again to ensure that the changes have been made to the
schema.

### Versioned Migrations
Alternatively, the versioned migration workflow, sometimes called "change-based migrations", allows each change to the
database schema to be checked into source control and reviewed during code-review. Users can still benefit from Atlas
intelligently planning migrations for them, however they are not automatically applied.

To start, we will calculate the difference between the _desired_ and _current_ state of the database by running the `atlas
migrate diff` command.

To run this command, we need to provide the necessary parameters:

* `--dir` the URL to the migration directory, by default it is `file://migrations`.
* `--to` the URL of the desired state, an HCL file or a database connection.
* `--dev-url` a URL to a [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) that will be used to compute the diff.

```shell
atlas migrate diff create_blog_posts \
  --dir="file://migrations" \
  --to="file://schema.hcl" \
  --dev-url="mysql://root:pass@:3306/test"
```

Run `ls migrations`, and you will notice that Atlas has created two files:


<Tabs
defaultValue="migration_file"
values={[
{label: '20220811074144_create_blog_posts.sql', value: 'migration_file'},
{label: 'atlas.sum', value: 'sum_file'},
]}>
<TabItem value="migration_file">

```sql
-- create "blog_posts" table
CREATE TABLE `example`.`blog_posts` (`id` int NOT NULL, `title` varchar(100) NULL, `body` text NULL, `author_id` int NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), INDEX `author_id` (`author_id`), CONSTRAINT `author_fk` FOREIGN KEY (`author_id`) REFERENCES `example`.`users` (`id`))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sum_file">

In addition to the migration directory, Atlas maintains a file name `atlas.sum` which is used
to ensure the integrity of the migration directory and force developers to deal with situations
where migration order or contents was modified after the fact.

```text
h1:t1fEP1rSsGf1gYrYCjsGyEyuM0cnhATlq93B7h8uXxY=
20220811074144_create_blog_posts.sql h1:liZcCBbAn/HyBTqBAEVar9fJNKPTb2Eq+rEKZeCFC9M=
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have our migration files ready, you can use your favorite migration tool to apply the changes generated by
Atlas.

### Next Steps
In this short tutorial we learned how to use Atlas to inspect databases, as well as use declarative and versioned
migrations. Read more about the use-cases for the two approaches [here](/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned) to help you
decide which workflow works best for you.
