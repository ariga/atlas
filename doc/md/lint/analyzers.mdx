The database is often the most critical component in software architectures. Being a stateful component, it cannot be
easily rebuilt, scaled-out or fixed by a restart. Outages that involve damage to data or simply unavailability of the database
are notoriously hard to manage and recover from, often taking long hours of careful work by a team's most senior
engineers.

As most outages happen directly as a result of a change to a system, Atlas provides users with means to verify the
safety of planned changes before they happen. The [`sqlcheck`](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas@master/sql/sqlcheck)
package provides interfaces for analyzing the contents of SQL files to generate insights on the safety of many kinds of
changes to database schemas. With this package developers may define an `Analyzer` that can be used to diagnose the impact
of SQL statements on the target database.

Using these interfaces, Atlas provides different `Analyzer` implementations that are useful for determining the
safety of migration scripts.

## Analyzers

Below are the `Analyzer` implementations currently supported by Atlas.

### Non-Linear Changes

Non-additive changes, often referred to as non-linear changes, are changes to the migration directory that are not added
in a sequential order. This is a bit like the linear history in version control systems, where migration files are
commits and the migration directory is the repository. Let's explain with three examples why ensuring the linearity of the
migration directory is important:

- When a developer introduces a new migration file without having the **latest state** of the directory, there is a risk
  of generating an incorrect file that might conflict with the actual schema and cause a failure during deployment.
- When a developer merges a feature branch to the main branch with a new migration file that is not positioned at the
  end of the directory, there is a risk that Atlas will skip this migration file, as there might be some database that already
  contains a higher version of the migration directory. This scenario can cause unexpected and surprising behavior during
  deployments.
- Having non-linear history can make it challenging to roll back (or revert changes) to a specific version of the migration
  directory, as the state of the database might be different than the state of the migration directory. Applying the migration
  directory in consistent order promises deterministic behavior.

Luckily, Atlas detects non-linear and non-additive changes made to a migration directory.
To enable this behavior in your project, integrate Atlas into your [GitHub Actions](/cloud/setup-ci) or [GitLab](/guides/ci-platforms/gitlab)
CI pipelines, and Atlas will automatically detect and report non-linear changes during the CI run.

### Destructive Changes

Destructive changes are changes to a database schema that result in loss of data. For instance,
consider a statement such as:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `users` DROP COLUMN `email_address`;
```
This statement is considered destructive because whatever data is stored in the `email_address` column
will be deleted from disk, with no way to recover it. There are definitely situations where this type
of change is desired, but they are relatively rare. Using the `destructive` ([GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas@master/sql/sqlcheck/destructive))
Analyzer, teams can detect this type of change and design workflows that prevent it from happening accidentally.

Running migration linting locally on in CI fails with exit code 1 in case destructive changes are detected. However,
users can disable this by configuring the `destructive` analyzer in the [`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting)
file:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {2-4}
lint {
  destructive {
    error = false
  }
}
```

### Data-dependent Changes

Data-dependent changes are changes to a database schema that _may_ succeed or fail, depending on the
data that is stored in the database. For instance, consider a statement such as:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `example`.`orders` ADD UNIQUE INDEX `idx_name` (`name`);
```
This statement is considered data-dependent because if the `orders` table
contains duplicate values on the name column we will not be able to add a uniqueness
constraint. Consider we added two records with the name `atlas` to the table:
```
mysql> create table orders ( name varchar(100) );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)

mysql> insert into orders (name) values ("atlas");
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

mysql> insert into orders (name) values ("atlas");
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```
Attempting to add a uniqueness constraint on the `name` column, will fail:
```sql
mysql> ALTER TABLE `example`.`orders` ADD UNIQUE INDEX `idx_name` (`name`);
// highlight-next-line-error-message
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'atlas' for key 'orders.idx_name'
```
This type of change is tricky because a developer trying to simulate it locally
might succeed in performing it only to be surprised that their migration script
fails in production, breaking a deployment sequence or causing other unexpected
behavior. Using the `data_depend` ([GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas@master/sql/sqlcheck/datadepend))
Analyzer, teams can detect this risk early and account for it in pre-deployment checks to a database.

By default, data-dependent changes are reported but not cause migration linting to fail. Users can change this by
configuring the `data_depend` analyzer in the [`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting) file:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {2-4}
lint {
  data_depend {
    error = true
  }
}
```

### Backward Incompatible Changes

Backward-incompatible changes, also known as breaking changes, are schema changes that have the potential to break the contract with applications that rely on
the old schema. For instance, renaming a column from `email_address` to `email` can cause errors during deployment
(migration) phase if applications running the previous version of the schema reference the old column name in their
queries.

By default, detected breaking changes are reported but do not cause migration linting to fail. Users can change this by
configuring the `incompatible` analyzer in the [`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting) file:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {2-4}
lint {
  incompatible {
    error = true
  }
}
```

### Naming Conventions Policy

In database schema design, maintaining consistency and readability through naming conventions is a widely common
practice. Atlas provides an analyzer that can help enforce naming conventions on a variety of schema resources,
including tables, columns, and indexes.

Users can enable this by configuring the `naming` analyzer in their
[`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting) file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Global policy">

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
lint {
  naming {
    match   = "^[a-z]+$"
    message = "must be lowercase"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Resource-specific policy">

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
lint {
  naming {
    match   = "^[a-z]+$"
    message = "must be lowercase"
    // highlight-start
    index {
      match   = "^[a-z]+_idx$"
      message = "must be lowercase and end with _idx"
    }
    // highlight-end
    // schema, table, column, foreign_key and check are also supported.
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, detected naming violations are reported but do not cause migration linting to fail. Users can change this by
configuring the `naming` analyzer in the [`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting) file:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {2-6}
lint {
  naming {
    error   = true
    match   = "^[a-z]+$"
    message = "must be lowercase"
  }
}
```

### Concurrent Index Policy (PostgreSQL)

Schema changes like `CREATE INDEX` or `DROP INDEX` can cause the database to lock the table against write operations.
Luckily, PostgreSQL provides the
[`CONCURRENTLY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY) option that
may be more resource-intensive, but allows normal database operations to continue while the index is built or dropped.

Atlas provides an analyzer that identifies non-concurrent index creation or deletion for tables not created within the
same file, and recommends executing them concurrently.

Additionally, since indexes cannot be created or deleted concurrently within a transaction, Atlas ensures the
`atlas:txmode none` directive exists in the file header to prevent this file from running in a transaction. This check
can be disabled along with the other ones as follows:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
lint {
  concurrent_index {
    // highlight-start
    check_create = false // `true` by default.
    check_drop   = false // `true` by default.
    check_txmode = false // `true` by default.
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

By default, detected concurrent index violations are reported but do not cause migration linting to fail. Users can
change this by configuring the `concurrent_index` analyzer in the
[`atlas.hcl`](../atlas-schema/projects#configure-migration-linting) file:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
lint {
  concurrent_index {
    // highlight-next-line
    error = true
  }
}
```

#### DS101 {#DS101}

Destructive change that is reported when a database schema was dropped. For example:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA test;
```

#### DS102 {#DS102}

A destructive change is reported when a table is dropped, posing a risk of data loss. For example:

```sql
DROP TABLE t;
```

The suggested solution is to back up the data before dropping the table, or add a [pre-migration check](/versioned/checks)
to ensure that the table is empty before dropping it:

```diff
+ -- atlas:txtar
+
+ -- checks/destructive.sql --
+ SELECT NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t1) AS t1_empty;
+
+ -- migration.sql --
DROP TABLE t1;
```

#### DS103 {#DS103}

A destructive change is reported when a non-virtual column is dropped, posing a risk of data loss. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c;
```

The suggest solution to resolve these errors is to add a [pre-migration check](/versioned/checks) that ensures the
column is empty before dropping it:

```diff
+ -- atlas:txtar
+
+ -- checks/destructive.sql --
+ SELECT NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t WHERE c IS NOT NULL) AS t_c_empty;
+
+ -- migration.sql --
ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c;
```

#### MF101 {#MF101}

Adding a unique index to a table might fail in case one of the indexed columns contain duplicate entries. For example:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX i ON t(c);
```

#### MF102 {#MF102}

Modifying a non-unique index to be unique might fail in case one of the indexed columns contain duplicate entries.

:::note
Since index modification is done with `DROP` and `CREATE`, this check will be reported only when analyzing changes
programmatically or when working with the [declarative workflow](../concepts/workflows.md#declarative-migrations).
:::

#### MF103 {#MF103}

Adding a non-nullable column to a table might fail in case the table is not empty. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c int NOT NULL;
```

#### MF104 {#MF104}

Modifying nullable column to non-nullable might fail in case it contains NULL values. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY COLUMN c int NOT NULL;
```

The solution, in this case, is to backfill `NULL` values with a default value:

```sql {1}
UPDATE t SET c = 0 WHERE c IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY COLUMN c int NOT NULL;
```

#### BC101 {#BC101}

Renaming a table is a backward-incompatible change that can cause errors during deployment (migration) if
applications running the previous version of the schema refer to the old name in their statements. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `users` RENAME TO `Users`;
```

Unlike other checks, there is no single correct way to resolve this one. Here are some possible solutions:

1. It's likely that this change was introduced when you renamed one of the entities in your ORM, and the linter
helped you catch the potential problem this could cause. In such cases, most ORM frameworks allow you to rename the
entity while still pointing to its previous table name. e.g., here is how you can do it in
[Ent](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-annotations#custom-table-name) and in [GORM](https://gorm.io/docs/conventions.html#TableName).

2. If renaming is desired but the previous version of the application uses the old table name, a temporary `VIEW`
can be created to mimic the previous schema version in the deployment phase. However, the downside of this solution is
that mutations using the old table name will fail. Yet, if Atlas detects a consecutive statement with a
`CREATE VIEW <old_name>`, it will ignore this check.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `users` RENAME TO `Users`;
  CREATE VIEW `users` AS SELECT * FROM `Users`;
  ```

3. If renaming the table is desired and no clients depend on it yet, or if it is acceptable to return errors during
migration phase when traffic is minimal, you can configure Atlas to ignore this check with the following directive:
  ```sql
  -- atlas:nolint BC101
  ALTER TABLE `users` RENAME TO `Users`;
  ```


#### BC102 {#BC102}

Renaming a column is a backward-incompatible change that can cause errors during deployment (migration) if
applications running the previous version of the schema refer to the old column name in their statements. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `users` RENAME COLUMN `user_name` TO `name`;
```

Unlike other checks, there is no single correct way to resolve this one. Here are some possible solutions:

1. It's likely that this change was introduced when you renamed a field in one of the entities in your ORM, and the
  linter helped you catch the potential problem this could cause. In such cases, most ORM frameworks allow you to rename
  a field while still pointing to its previous column name. e.g., in [Ent](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-fields#storage-key)
  you can configure it using the [`StorageKey`](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-fields#storage-key) option, and in
  [GORM](https://gorm.io/docs/models.html#Fields-Tags) you can set it by adding the `column` struct tag.

2. If renaming is desired but the previous version of the application uses the old column name, a temporary `VIRTUAL`
   [generated column](/atlas-schema/hcl#generated-columns) can be created to mimic the previous schema version
   in the deployment phase. However, the downside of this solution is that mutations using the old column name will fail.
   Yet, if Atlas detects a consecutive command with such a column, it will ignore this check.
  ```sql
  -- For MySQL or MariaDB:
  ALTER TABLE `posts` RENAME COLUMN `id` TO `uid`, ADD COLUMN `id` int AS (`uid`);

  -- SQLite:
  ALTER TABLE `posts` RENAME COLUMN `id` TO `uid`;
  ALTER TABLE `posts` ADD COLUMN `id` int AS (`uid`);
  ```

3. If renaming the column is desired and no clients depend on it yet, or if it is acceptable to return errors during
   the migration phase when traffic is minimal, you can configure Atlas to ignore this check with the following directive:
  ```sql
  -- atlas:nolint BC102
  ALTER TABLE `posts` RENAME COLUMN `id` TO `uid`;
  ```


#### CD101 {#CD101}

Constraint deletion is reported when a foreign-key constraint was dropped. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE pets DROP CONSTRAINT owner_id;
```

#### MY101 {#MY101}

Adding a non-nullable column to a table without a `DEFAULT` value implicitly sets existing rows with the column
zero (default) value. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c int NOT NULL;
// highlight-next-line
-- Append column `c` to all existing rows with the value 0.
```

#### MY102 {#MY102}

Adding a column with an inline `REFERENCES` clause has no actual effect. Users should define a separate `FOREIGN KEY`
specification instead. For example:

```diff
-CREATE TABLE pets (owner_id int REFERENCES users(id));
+CREATE TABLE pets (owner_id int, FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES users(id));
```

#### MY110 {#MY110}

Removing enum values from a column changes the column type and requires a table copy. During this process, the table
is locked for write operations. In addition, operation may fail if the column contains values that are not in the new
enum definition.

#### MY111 {#MY111}

Reordering enum values of a colum requires a table copy. During this process, the table is locked for write operations.

Note that since the order of the enum values defines how the table is sorted when using `ORDER BY` on the column,
controlling the ordering behavior can be achieved using the `DESC` clause or expressions as follows:

```sql {1,4}
-- Instead of reversing the enum values.
SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY enum_column DESC;

-- Instead of reordering the enum values.
SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY CASE enum_column WHEN 'a' THEN 1 WHEN 'b' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END;
```

#### MY112 {#MY112}

Inserting new enum values not at the end requires table copy. During this process, the table is locked for write operations.

If possible, it is recommended to add new enum values at the end of the enum definition.

#### MY113 {#MY113}

Exceeding 256 enum values changes storage size and requires a table copy. During this process, the table is locked for
write operations.

#### MY120 {#MY120}

Removing set values from a column requires a table copy. During this process, the table
is locked for write operations. In addition, operation may fail if the column contains values that are not in the new
set definition.

#### MY121 {#MY121}

Reordering set values of a colum requires a table copy. During this process, the table is locked for write operations.

#### MY122 {#MY122}

Inserting new set values not at the end requires table copy. During this process, the table is locked for write operations.

If possible, it is recommended to add new set values at the end of the set definition.

#### MY123 {#MY123}

Adding set values to a column changes its storage size and requires a table copy, if the new amount changes the number of bytes needed for the bitmap.
The storage size of a set column is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the number of values:
One byte can store up to 8 values, two bytes can store up to 16 etc.

During this process, the table is locked for write operations.

#### LT101 {#LT101}

Modifying a nullable column to non-nullable without setting a `DEFAULT` might fail in case it contains `NULL` values.
The solution is one of the following:

1\. Set a `DEFAULT` value on the modified column:

```sql {2}
-- create "new_users" table
CREATE TABLE `new_users` (`a` int NOT NULL DEFAULT 1);
-- copy rows from old table "users" to new temporary table "new_users"
INSERT INTO `new_users` (`a`) SELECT IFNULL(`a`, 1) FROM `users`;
-- drop "users" table after copying rows
DROP TABLE `users`;
-- rename temporary table "new_users" to "users"
ALTER TABLE `new_users` RENAME TO `users`;
```

2\. Backfill `NULL` values with a default value:

```sql {1-2}
-- backfill previous rows
UPDATE `users` SET `a` = 1 WHERE `a` IS NULL;
-- disable the enforcement of foreign-keys constraints
PRAGMA foreign_keys = off;
-- create "new_users" table
CREATE TABLE `new_users` (`a` int NOT NULL);
-- copy rows from old table "users" to new temporary table "new_users"
INSERT INTO `new_users` (`a`) SELECT `a` FROM `users`;
-- drop "users" table after copying rows
DROP TABLE `users`;
-- rename temporary table "new_users" to "users"
ALTER TABLE `new_users` RENAME TO `users`;
-- enable back the enforcement of foreign-keys constraints
PRAGMA foreign_keys = on;
```

Creating a table with optimal data alignment may help minimize the amount of required disk space.
For example consider the next Postgres table on a 64-bit system:

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    premium boolean,
    balance integer,
    age     smallint
);
```
Each tuple in the table takes 24 bytes of successive memory without the header.
the `id` attribute takes 8 bytes, the `premium` takes 1 byte and 3 bytes of padding, the `balance` takes 4 bytes and the `age` takes 2 bytes,
and lastly 6 bytes of padding allocated for the end of the row.
In total 9 bytes of padding are allocated for each row.

Compared to same table with different ordering which only takes 16 bytes in memory with 1 byte of padding:

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    balance integer,
    age smallint,
    premium boolean
);
```

#### PG101 <LoginRequired /> {#PG101}
Creating an index non-concurrently acquires a `SHARE` lock on the table blocking writes but allowing reads during the
operation.

#### PG102 <LoginRequired />  {#PG102}
Dropping an index non-concurrently acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table blocking both reads and writes
during the operation.

#### PG103 <LoginRequired />  {#PG103}
Indexes cannot be created or deleted concurrently within a transaction. Add the `atlas:txmode none` directive to the
header to prevent this file from running in a transaction.

#### PG104 <LoginRequired />  {#PG104}
Adding a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint (with its index) acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table, blocking all access
during the operation. The solution is to add as follows:

1. Create the `UNIQUE INDEX` concurrently:

  ```sql title=20240101000001_add_unique_index.sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_pkey ON users(id);
  ```

2. Validate the index creation and ensure it is in `VALID` state. Otherwise, the constraint creation will
   fail with the following error:
   ```sql
   // highlight-next-line-error-message
   ERROR:  index "users_pkey" is not a valid
   ```
   Note, this step can be automated using a [pre-migration check](/versioned/checks) on the migration file below.

3. After validating the index state, add the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint using the created index:

  ```sql title=20240101000002_add_primary_key.sql
  ALTER TABLE users ADD PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX users_pkey;
  ```


#### PG105 <LoginRequired />  {#PG105}
Adding a `UNIQUE` constraint (with its index) acquires an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table, blocking all access
during the operation. The solution is to add as follows:

1. Create the `UNIQUE INDEX` concurrently:

  ```sql title=20240101000001_add_unique_index.sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_id_key ON users(id);
  ```

2. Validate the index creation and ensure it is in `VALID` state. Otherwise, the constraint creation will
  fail with the following error:

  ```sql
  // highlight-next-line-error-message
  ERROR:  index "users_id_key" is not a valid
   ```
  Note, this step can be automated using a [pre-migration check](/versioned/checks) on the migration file below.

3. After validating the index state, add the `UNIQUE` constraint using the created index:

  ```sql title=20240101000002_add_unique_const.sql
  ALTER TABLE users ADD UNIQUE USING INDEX users_id_key;
  ```

#### PG301 <LoginRequired /> {#PG301}
A change to the column type that requires adjusting the actual stored data and triggers a rewrite of the table and potentially
indexes. During this operation, an [`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-TABLES)
lock is acquired on the table, preventing any level of access, including `SELECT`.

#### PG302 <LoginRequired /> {#PG302}
Adding a column with a volatile `DEFAULT` value requires a rewrite of the table. During this operation, an
[`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-TABLES) lock is acquired on the
table, preventing any level of access, including `SELECT`.

#### PG303 <LoginRequired /> {#PG303}
Modifying a column from `NULL` to `NOT NULL` requires a full table scan. During this operation, an
[`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-TABLES) lock is acquired on the
table, preventing any level of access, including `SELECT`.

:::note Columns with CHECK constraints
If the table has a `CHECK` constraint that ensures `NULL` cannot exist, such as `CHECK (c > 10 AND c IS NOT NULL)`,
the table scan is skipped, and therefore this check is not reported.
:::

#### PG304 <LoginRequired /> {#PG304}
Adding a `PRIMARY KEY` on a nullable columns implicitly sets them to `NOT NULL`, resulting a full table scan unless
there is a `CHECK` constraint that ensures `NULL` cannot exist.

#### PG305 <LoginRequired /> {#PG305}
Adding a `CHECK` constraint without the `NOT VALID` clause requires scanning the table to verify that all rows satisfy
the constraint. During this operation, an [`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-TABLES)
lock is acquired on the table, preventing any level of access, including `SELECT`.

#### PG306 <LoginRequired /> {#PG306}
Adding a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint without the `NOT VALID` clause requires a full table scan to verify that all rows
satisfy the constraint. During this process, a `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE` lock is acquired on both tables blocking write
operations.
