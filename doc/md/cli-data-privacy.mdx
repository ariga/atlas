As mentioned on the [Feature Compatability](/features) page, users can unlock advanced features by logging in with the
Atlas CLI. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
atlas login
```

After running this command, follow the instructions on the screen to log in. If needed, you will be prompted
to create an account.

## What data does the Atlas CLI collect?

:::info Logged-in Users

Notice that this document is only relevant to users who have logged in with the Atlas CLI. If you have not logged in,
the CLI does not collect any data from you.

:::

As a database management tool, Atlas has access to a lot of sensitive data. We take privacy and security very seriously,
and we want to be transparent about what data we collect and how we use it.

If you want the full details in formal and legal language you can read our [Privacy Policy](https://ariga.io/legal/privacy)
and [SaaS Agreement](https://ariga.io/legal/saas) which you sign when you create an account, but here is a summary of
the data we collect in layman's terms.

### Data we DON'T collect

* **Your Data**: We don't collect any data from your databases. We don't know what data you have in your databases,
  and we don't have access to it.
* **Your Database Passwords**: We don't collect, transmit or store your database passwords.
* **Your database schema or migrations**: Unless you explicitly use a command or flag that sends us your schema or
  migrations (as described below), we don't collect, transmit or store your database schema, migrations or execution logs

### Data we DO collect

* **Errors and Crashes** - We collect error and crash reports to help us improve the CLI. This includes things like the
  stack trace of the error, the command you were running, and the version of the CLI you were using. We are very careful
  not to collect and transmit any sensitive data in these reports.
* **Data you choose to report** - Some Atlas commands, such as `migrate push` (which is used to upload your migration
  directory to the Atlas Schema Registry) or flags (like running `schema inspect` with the `--web` or `-w` flag), naturally
  involve sending us data. See below for more details on these commands and flags.
* **Basic Telemetry** - We collect basic telemetry data to help us understand how users are using the CLI and to enforce
  license restrictions.

  This includes things like the commands you run, general information about the runtime environment (like OS version
  or if you're running on GitHub Actions), your local hostname, the type of database you're using, and the version
  of the  CLI you're using. We are very careful not to collect and transmit any sensitive data in these reports.

### We only collect what you send us

In principle, aside from basic telemetry and error reporting (with no sensitive data), we only collect data that you
explicitly choose to send us. Consider the following list of commands and flags that send us data:

* `schema inspect` when used with the `--web` or `-w` flag: This flag opens a web browser to view the schema of your
  database. This the schema of your database.
* `migrate push`: This command uploads your migration directory to the Atlas Schema Registry. This includes your schema
  and migrations.
* `migrate apply` when used with a directory that is stored in the schema registry (e.g the url has a `atlas://` prefix)
  AND the `--env` flag is used: This flag applies a migration from the Atlas Schema Registry to your database and uploads
  the execution logs to the Atlas Cloud, updating the status of the target database in your account. We also store the
  hostname of the target database to help you identify to which database the logs belong.
* `schema apply` when used with the interactive `Lint and Edit` mode: This mode allows you to edit your schema in a
  visual editor and then apply the changes to your database. This sends your schema to the Atlas Cloud for processing.
* `migrate lint` when used with the `--web` or `-w` flag: This flag opens a web browser to view the linting results of
  your migrations. This sends your migrations to the Atlas Cloud for processing.

## How do we use the data we collect?

We use the data we collect to improve the CLI and provide better support to our users. This includes things like:

* Fixing bugs and crashes
* Improving the performance of the CLI
* Understanding how users are using the CLI
* Providing better experience to users

We don't sell your data to third parties, and use it strictly in compliance with our [Privacy Policy](https://ariga.io/legal/privacy)
as well as applicable laws and regulations.  We take data privacy and security very seriously and hold ourselves accountable
to the highest standards.  To ensure this commitment is upheld we perform an annual SOC 2 audit which you can read more
