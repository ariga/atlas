Hi everyone,

We are excited to share our latest release with you! Here's what's new:
* [__Pre-migration Checks__](#pre-migration-checks): Before migrating your schema, you can now add SQL checks that will be verified to help avoid
risky migrations.
* [__Schema Docs__](#schema-docs): Atlas lets you manage your database schema as code. One of the things we love most
about code, is that because of its formal structure, it's possible to automatically generate documentation from it.
With this release, we're introducing a new feature that lets you generate code-grade documentation for your database schema.
* [__SQL Server Trigger Support__](#sql-server-trigger-support): Atlas now supports managing triggers in SQL Server.
* [__ClickHouse Materialized View Support__](#clickhouse-materialized-view-support): Atlas now supports managing materialized views in ClickHouse.

Let's dive in.

## Pre-migration Checks
Atlas now supports the concept of pre-migration checks, where each migration version can include a list of assertions
(predicates) that must evaluate to true before the migration is applied.

For example, before dropping a table, we aim to ensure that no data is deleted and the table must be empty, or we check
for the absence of duplicate values before adding a unique constraint to a table.

This is especially useful if we want to add our own specific logic to migration versions, and it helps to ensure that our
database changes are safe.

:::info Cloud Directory
Pre-migration checks work for Cloud connected directories. Check out the [introduction guide](/versioned/intro#pushing-migrations-to-atlas)
to get started with Atlas Cloud.
:::

To add these checks, Atlas supports a text-based file archive to describe "migration plans". Unlike regular migration files,
which mainly contain a list of DDL statements (with optional directives), Atlas `txtar` files (currently) support two file
types: migration files and pre-execution check files.

The code below presents a simple example of a pre-migration check. The default checks file is named `checks.sql`,
and the `migration.sql` file contains the actual DDLs to be executed on the database in case the assertions are passed.

```sql title="20240201131900_drop_users.sql"
-- atlas:txtar

// highlight-next-line
-- checks.sql --
-- The assertion below must be evaluated to true. Hence, the "users" table must not contain any rows.
SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);

// highlight-next-line
-- migration.sql --
-- The statement below will be executed only if the assertion above evaluates to true.
DROP TABLE users;
```

If the pre-execution checks pass, the migration will be applied, and Atlas will report the results.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```

![Check passed](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/cloud/deploy/check-passed.png)

```applylog title="Output"
Migrating to version 20240201131900 from 20240201131800 (1 migrations in total):
// highlight-start
  -- checks before migrating version 20240201131900
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM users);
  -- ok (624.004Âµs)
// highlight-end
  -- migrating version 20240201131900
    -> DROP TABLE users;
  -- ok (5.412737ms)
  -------------------------
  -- 22.138088ms
  -- 1 migration
  -- 1 check
  -- 1 sql statement
```

If the pre-execution checks fail, the migration will not be applied, and Atlas will exit with an error.

```bash
atlas migrate --dir atlas://app --env prod
```

![Check failed](https://atlasgo.io/uploads/cloud/deploy/check-failed.png)

```applylog title="Output"
Migrating to version 20240201131900 from 20240201131800 (1 migrations in total):
  -- checks before migrating version 20240201131900
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM internal_users);
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM external_users);
  -- ok (1.322842ms)
  -- checks before migrating version 20240201131900
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM roles);
    -> SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM user_roles);
    2 of 2 assertions failed: check assertion "SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM user_roles);" returned false
  -------------------------
  -- 19.396779ms
  -- 1 migration with errors
  -- 2 checks ok, 2 failures
Error: 2 of 2 assertions failed: check assertion "SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM user_roles);" returned false
```

To learn more about how to use pre-migration checks, read the documentation [here](/versioned/checks).

## Schema Docs

One of the most surprising things we learned from working with teams on their Atlas journey, is that many teams
do not have a single source of truth for their database schema.  As a result, it's impossible to maintain up-to-date
documentation for the database schema, which is crucial for disseminating knowledge about the database across the team.

Atlas changes this by creating a workflow that _begins_ with a single source of truth for the database schema - the
desired state of the database, as defined in code. This is what enables Atlas to automatically plan migrations, detect
drift (as we'll see below), and now, generate documentation.

### How it works

Documentation is currently generated for the most recent version of your schema for migration directories
that are pushed to Atlas Cloud. To generate docs for your schema, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the most recent version of Atlas:
   <InstallationInstructions/>

2. Login to Atlas Cloud using the CLI:

   ```bash
   atlas login
   ```
   If you do not already have a (free) Atlas Cloud account, follow the instructions to create one.

3. Push your migrations to Atlas Cloud:

   ```bash
   atlas migrate push <dir name>
   ```
   Be sure to replace `<dir name>` with the name of the directory containing your migrations. (e.g `app`)

4. Atlas will print a link to the overview page for your migration directory, e.g:
   ```
   https://gh.atlasgo.cloud/dirs/4294967296
   ```
5. Click on "Doc" in the top tabs to view the documentation for your schema.

## SQL Server Trigger Support

In [version v0.17](/blog/2024/01/01/atlas-v-0-17), we released trigger support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite. In this release, we have added support for SQL Server as well.

Triggers are a powerful feature of relational databases that allow you to run custom
code when certain events occur on a table or a view. For example, you can use triggers to
automatically update the amount of stock in your inventory when a new order is
placed or to create an audit log of changes to a table. Using this event-based approach,
you can implement complex business logic in your database, without having to write
any additional code in your application.

Managing triggers as part of the software development lifecycle can be quite a challenge.
Luckily, Atlas's database schema-as-code approach makes it easy to do!

:::info BETA FEATURE
Triggers are currently in beta and available to logged-in users only. To use this feature, run:

```
atlas login
```
:::

Let's use Atlas to build a small chunk of a simple e-commerce application:

1. Download the latest version of the Atlas CLI:
   <InstallationInstructions/>
2. Make sure you are logged in to Atlas:
   ```
   atlas login
   ```
3. Let's spin up a new SQL Server database using `docker`:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd0995' -p 1433:1433 --name atlas-demo -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:latest
    ```

4. Next, let's define and apply the base table for our application:

  ```hcl title=schema.hcl
  schema "dbo" {
  }
  table "grades" {
    schema = schema.dbo
    column "student_id" {
      null = false
      type = bigint
    }
    column "course_id" {
      null = false
      type = bigint
    }
    column "grade" {
      null = false
      type = int
    }
    column "grade_status" {
      null = true
      type = varchar(10)
    }
    primary_key {
      columns = [column.student_id, column.course_id]
    }
  }
  ```
    The `grades` table represents a student's grade for a specific course. The column `grade_status` will remain null
    at first, and we will use a trigger to update whether it the grade is pass or fail.

    Apply this schema on our local SQL Server instance using the Atlas CLI:

    ```bash
    atlas schema apply \
      --url "sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master" \
      --to "file://schema.hcl" \
      --dev-url "docker://sqlserver/2022-latest/dev?mode=schema" \
      --auto-approve
    ```

    This command will apply the schema defined in `schema.hcl` to the local SQL Server instance.
    Notice the `--auto-approve` flag, which instructs Atlas to automatically apply the schema
    without prompting for confirmation.

5. Now, let's define the logic to assign a `grade_status` using a `TRIGGER`. Append
   this definition to `schema.hcl`:

  ```hcl title=schema.hcl (continued)
    trigger "after_grade_insert" {
      on = table.grades
      after {
        insert = true
      }
      as = <<-SQL
       BEGIN
         SET NOCOUNT ON;

        UPDATE grades
        SET grade_status = CASE
            WHEN inserted.grade >= 70 THEN 'Pass'
            ELSE 'Fail'
            END
            FROM grades
        INNER JOIN inserted ON grades.student_id = inserted.student_id and grades.course_id = inserted.course_id;
        END
      SQL
    }
  ```

    We defined a `TRIGGER` called `after_grade_insert`. This trigger is
    executed after new rows are inserted or existing rows are updated into the `grades` table. The trigger
    executes the SQL statement, which updates the `grade_status` column to either 'Pass' or 'Fail' based on the grade.

    Apply the updated schema using the Atlas CLI:
    ```bash
    atlas schema apply \
      --url "sqlserver://sa:P@ssw0rd0995@localhost:1433?database=master" \
      --to "file://schema.hcl" \
      --dev-url "docker://sqlserver/2022-latest/dev?mode=schema" \
      --auto-approve
    ```
    Notice that Atlas automatically detects that we have added a new `TRIGGER`, and applies it to the database.

6. Finally, let's test our application to see that it actually works. We can do this by populating our database with
   some students' grades. To do so, connect to the SQL Server container and open a `sqlcmd` session.

    ```bash
    docker exec -it atlas-demo /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'P@ssw0rd0995'
    ```

    Now that a `sqlcmd` session is open, we can populate the items:

    ```bash
    INSERT INTO grades (student_id, course_id, grade, grade_status) VALUES (1, 1, 87, null);
    INSERT INTO grades (student_id, course_id, grade, grade_status) VALUES (1, 2, 99, null);
    INSERT INTO grades (student_id, course_id, grade, grade_status) VALUES (2, 2, 68, null);
    ```

   To exit the session write `Quit`.

   Now, let's check the `grades` table to see that the `grade_status` column was updated correctly:

   ```bash
    docker exec -it atlas-demo /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'P@ssw0rd0995' -Q "SELECT * FROM grades;"
    ```

   You should see the following output:

   ```
    student_id    course_id        grade   grade_status
    ---------- ------------- ----------- --------------
             1             1          87 Pass
             1             2          99 Pass
             2             2          68 Fail
    (3 rows affected)
   ```

   Amazing! Our trigger automatically updated the `grade_status` for each of the rows.

## ClickHouse Materialized View Support

A `materialized` view is a table-like structure that holds the results of a query. Unlike a regular view, the results of
a materialized view are stored in the database and can be refreshed periodically to reflect changes in the underlying data.

:::info LOGIN REQUIRED
Materialized views are currently available to logged-in users only. To use this feature, run:
```
atlas login
```
:::

Let's see an example of how to write a materialized view in [HCL](/atlas-schema/hcl) for a ClickHouse database:

```hcl
materialized "mat_view" {
  schema     = schema.public
  to         = table.dest
  as         = "SELECT * FROM table.src"
  depends_on = [table.src]
}
```

In the example above, when creating materialized views with `TO [db.]table`, the view will be created with the same structure as the table
or view specified in the `TO` clause.

The `engine` and `primary_key` attributes are required if the `TO` clause is not specified.
In this syntax, `populate` can be used for the first time to populate the materialized view:

```hcl
materialized "mat_view" {
  schema = schema.public
  engine = MergeTree
  column "id" {
    type = UInt32
  }
  column "name" {
    type = String
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
  as         = "SELECT * FROM table.src"
  populate   = true
  depends_on = [table.src]
}
```

:::info
Note that modifying the materialized view structure
after the initial creation is not supported by Atlas currently.
:::

## Wrapping up

That's it! I hope you try out (and enjoy) all of these new features and find them useful.
As always, we would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zZ6sWVg6NT).
