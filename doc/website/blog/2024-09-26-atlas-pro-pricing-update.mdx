Hey Atlas Users,

We wanted to share some important updates regarding changes to our Atlas Pro plan that will come into effect soon.

### What's Changing?

Starting September 27th, 2024, [Atlas Pro](/pricing) seats will no longer be available for free. New users will still have access
to a 30-day free trial, but after that, a license will be required to continue using Atlas Pro.

For our existing users, don't worry! We've got you covered with a 30-day grace period to upgrade your account.
Plus, we're offering each company credits that should cover their bill for an additional month.

For our **existing paying users**, as a token of our appreciation, you'll continue to receive **3 free seats** on top of what
you've already paid for, which means you are not impacted by this change. We value your continued support and want to 
make sure you're getting even more out of Atlas Pro.

We also recognize that many of you are using Atlas Pro for non-commercial projects, so we're excited to introduce the
[Atlas Pro Hacker License](/hacker-license)! This license offers full access to Atlas Pro features for students, maintainers of
open-source projects, and hobbyists working on non-commercial software.

### Why Are We Doing This?

At its core, Atlas has always been an open-source project available for anyone to use. However, to ensure the long-term 
sustainability and success of Atlas, we believe it's important to have a strong, profitable business model. 
This allows us to continue building and maintaining Atlas for the future, while fostering a vibrant community around it.

### What You Need to Do

To continue using Atlas Pro, you'll need to upgrade your organization's account by October 27th, 2024. You can do this
by heading over to the *Settings* page for your organization, where you'll be able to purchase Atlas Pro through Stripe or
directly via [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-moxc4333krar2).

* Apply for company credits [here](https://forms.gle/NDSYJtyaFrqL9RfGA).
* Apply for the free Atlas Pro Hacker License [here](https://forms.gle/WdszyL8r4xhYKFMj7).

We appreciate your support and understanding as we make these changes. If you have any questions or need assistance,
don't hesitate to reach out to us via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zZ6sWVg6NT) or at
[hello@ariga.io](mailto:hello@ariga.io)!

All the best,
Ariel and Rotem
