Wikipedia defines [Multi-tenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) as:
> a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server
> and serves multiple tenants.

In recent years, multitenancy has become a common topic in our industry as many organizations provide service
to multiple customers using the same infrastructure. Multitenancy usually becomes an issue in software
architecture because tenants often expect a decent level of isolation from one another.

In this post, I will go over different known approaches for achieving multi-tenancy
and discuss the approach we took to build [Ariga's cloud platform](https://ariga.io).
In addition, I will demonstrate how we added built-in support for multi-tenant
environments in Atlas to overcome some of the challenges we faced.


### Introduction

Throughout the last few years, I have had the opportunity to implement multi-tenancy in various ways. Some of them
might be familiar to you:

1. A separate environment (deployment) per tenant, where isolation is achieved at both compute and data layers.
2. A schema (named database) per tenant, where there is one environment for compute (e.g., a K8S cluster), but tenants
are stored in different databases or schemas. Isolation is achieved at the data layer while compute resources are shared.
3. One environment for all tenants, including the data layer. Typically, in this case, each table holds a `tenant_id`
column that is used to filter statements by the tenant. Both data and compute layers are shared, with isolation achieved
at the logical, database query level.

Each approach has pros and cons, but I want to briefly list the main reasons we chose to build
our cloud platform based on the second option: schema per tenant.

1. **Management**: Easily delete, backup tenants, and allow them to export their data without affecting others.
2. **Isolation**: Limit credentials, connection pooling, and quotas per tenant. This way, one tenant cannot cause the
database to choke and interrupt other tenants in case they share the same physical database.
3. **Security and data privacy**: In case it is required, some tenants can be physically separated from others.
For example, data can be stored in the tenant's AWS account, and the application can connect to it using a secure
connection, like VPC peering in AWS.
4. **Code-maintenance**: Most of the application code is written in a way that it is unaware of the multi-tenancy. In our case,
there is one layer "at the top" that attaches the tenant connection to the context, and the API layer (e.g., GraphQL
resolver) extracts the connection from the context to read/write data. As a result, we are not concerned that API
changes will cross tenant boundaries.
5. **Migration**: Schema changes can be executed first on _"test tenants"_ and _fail-fast_ in case of error.

The primary con to this approach was that there was no elegant way to execute migrations on multiple databases
(_N_ times) in Atlas. In the rest of the post, I'll cover how we solved this problem in Ariga and added built-in
support for multi-tenancy in Atlas.

### Atlas config file

Atlas provides a convenient way to describe and interact with multiple environments using project files. A project file
is a file named `atlas.hcl` and contains one or more `env` blocks. For example:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
env "local" {
  url = "mysql://root:pass@:3306/"
  migrations {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
}

env "prod" {
  // ... a different env
}
```

Once defined, a project's environment can be worked against using the `--env` flag. For example:

```bash
atlas schema apply --env local
```

The command above runs the `schema apply` against the database that is defined in the `local` environment.

### Multi-Tenant environments

The Atlas configuration language provides a few capabilities adopted from Terraform to facilitate the definition of
multi-tenant environments. The first is the `for_each` meta-argument that allows defining a single `env` block that
is expanded to _N_ instances, one for each tenant. For example:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
variable "url" {
  type    = string
  default = "mysql://root:pass@:3306/"
}

variable "tenants" {
  type = list(string)
}

env "local" {
  for_each = toset(var.tenants)
  url      = urlsetpath(var.url, each.value)
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
}
```

The above configuration expects a list of tenants to be provided as a variable. This can be useful when the list of
tenants is dynamic and can be injected into the Atlas command. The `urlsetpath` function is a helper function that sets
the path of the database URL to the tenant name. For example, if `url` is set to `mysql://root:pass@:3306/?param=value`
and the tenant name is `tenant1`, the resulting URL will be `mysql://root:pass@:3306/tenant1?param=value`.

The second capability is [_Data Sources_](/atlas-schema/projects#data-sources). This option enables users to retrieve
information stored in an external service or database. For the sake of this example, let's extend the configuration
above to use the SQL data source to retrieve the list of tenants from the _INFORMATION_SCHEMA_ in MySQL:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
// The URL of the database we operate on.
variable "url" {
  type    = string
  default = "mysql://root:pass@:3306/"
}

// Schemas that match this pattern will be considered tenants.
variable "pattern" {
  type    = string
  default = "tenant_%"
}

data "sql" "tenants" {
  url   = var.url
  query = <<EOS
SELECT `schema_name`
  FROM `information_schema`.`schemata`
  WHERE `schema_name` LIKE ?
EOS
  args = [var.pattern]
}

env "local" {
  for_each = toset(data.sql.tenants.values)
  url      = urlsetpath(var.url, each.value)
}
```

### Example

Let's demonstrate how managing migrations in a multi-tenant architecture is made simple with Atlas.

1\. Install Atlas
<InstallationInstructions />

2\. Create a migration directory with the following example content:

<Tabs
defaultValue="migration_file1"
values={[
{label: '20220811074144_create_users.sql', value: 'migration_file1'},
{label: '20220811074314_add_users_name.sql', value: 'migration_file2'},
{label: 'atlas.sum', value: 'sum_file'},
]}>
<TabItem value="migration_file1">

```sql
-- create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` int NOT NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="migration_file2">

```sql
-- modify "users" table
ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sum_file">

```text
h1:w2ODzVxhTKdBVBdzqntHw7rHV8lKQF98TmNevOEZfIo=
20220811074144_create_users_table.sql h1:KnMSZM/E4TBGidYCZ+UHxkHEWaRWeyuPIUjSHRybQqA=
20220811074314_add_users_name.sql h1:jUpaANgD0SjI5DjaHuJxtHZ6Wq98act0MmE5oZ+NRU0=
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3\. Create two example tenants on a local database:

```sql
create database tenant_a8m;
create database tenant_rotemtam;
```

4\. Run Atlas to execute the migration scripts on the tenants' databases:

```
atlas migrate apply --env local
```

```text title="tenant_a8m"
Migrating to version 20220811074314 (2 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 20220811074144
    -> CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` int NOT NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
  -- ok (36.803179ms)

  -- migrating version 20220811074314
    -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
  -- ok (26.184177ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 72.899146ms
  -- 2 migrations
  -- 2 sql statements
```
```text title="tenant_rotemtam"
Migrating to version 20220811074314 (2 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 20220811074144
    -> CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` int NOT NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
  -- ok (61.987153ms)

  -- migrating version 20220811074314
    -> ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
  -- ok (24.656515ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 95.233384ms
  -- 2 migrations
  -- 2 sql statements
```

Running the command again will not execute any migrations:

```shell
No migration files to execute
No migration files to execute
```

### Migration logging

At Ariga, our services print structured logs (JSON) to feed our observability tools. That is why we felt obligated to
add support for custom log formatting in Atlas. To continue the example from above, we present how we configure Atlas to
emit JSON lines with the tenant name attached to them.

1\. Add the `log` configuration to the `local` environment block:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl" {4-15}
env "local" {
  for_each = toset(data.sql.tenants.values)
  url      = urlsetpath(var.url, each.value)
  // Emit JSON logs to stdout and add the
  // tenant name to each log line.
  log {
    migrate {
      apply = format(
        "{{ json . | json_merge %q }}",
        jsonencode({
          Tenant : each.value
        })
      )
    }
  }
}
```

2\. Create a new script file in the migration directory:

<Tabs
defaultValue="migration_file1"
values={[
{label: '20220811074144_create_users.sql', value: 'migration_file1'},
{label: '20220811074314_add_users_name.sql', value: 'migration_file2'},
{label: '20221027125605_create_pets.sql', value: 'migration_file3'},
{label: 'atlas.sum', value: 'sum_file'},
]}>
<TabItem value="migration_file1">

```sql
-- create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` int NOT NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="migration_file2">

```sql
-- modify "users" table
ALTER TABLE `users` ADD COLUMN `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="migration_file3">

```sql
-- create "pets" table
CREATE TABLE `pets` (`id` bigint, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sum_file">

```text
h1:coAZ5kxfT6EpZLjsMRWZv+lYAuChLTnhOnRjAVbZOao=
20220811074144_create_users.sql h1:INH5s7+VEs2pO4+YqL1XNvJUPnF5abhReSEz75L6fz0=
20220811074314_add_users_name.sql h1:EHo+0gM1Cpfl1pe0Cid35qr9mWUhQ9FSXSr+pHUwQwk=

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3\. Run `migrate apply` in our "local" environment:

```shell
atlas migrate apply --env local
```
```json
{"Applied":[{"Applied":["CREATE TABLE `pets` (`id` bigint, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));"],"Description":"create_pets","End":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.685899+03:00","Name":"20221027125605_create_pets.sql","Start":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.655879+03:00","Version":"20221027125605"}],"Current":"20220811074314","Dir":"migrations","Driver":"mysql","End":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.685899+03:00","Pending":[{"Description":"create_pets","Name":"20221027125605_create_pets.sql","Version":"20221027125605"}],"Start":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.647091+03:00","Target":"20221027125605","Tenant":"tenant_a8m","URL":{"ForceQuery":false,"Fragment":"","Host":":3308","OmitHost":false,"Opaque":"","Path":"/tenant_a8m","RawFragment":"","RawPath":"","RawQuery":"parseTime=true","Schema":"tenant_a8m","Scheme":"mysql","User":{}}}
{"Applied":[{"Applied":["CREATE TABLE `pets` (`id` bigint, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));"],"Description":"create_pets","End":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.787476+03:00","Name":"20221027125605_create_pets.sql","Start":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.757463+03:00","Version":"20221027125605"}],"Current":"20220811074314","Dir":"migrations","Driver":"mysql","End":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.787476+03:00","Pending":[{"Description":"create_pets","Name":"20221027125605_create_pets.sql","Version":"20221027125605"}],"Start":"2022-10-27T16:03:03.748399+03:00","Target":"20221027125605","Tenant":"tenant_rotemtam","URL":{"ForceQuery":false,"Fragment":"","Host":":3308","OmitHost":false,"Opaque":"","Path":"/tenant_rotemtam","RawFragment":"","RawPath":"","RawQuery":"parseTime=true","Schema":"tenant_rotemtam","Scheme":"mysql","User":{}}}
```

### Next steps

Currently, Atlas uses a _fail-fast_ policy, which means the process exits on the first tenant that returns an error.
We built it this way because we find it helpful to execute migrations first on _"test tenants"_ and stop in case the
operation fails on any of them. However, this means the execution is serial and may be slow in cases where there is a
large amount of tenants. Therefore, we aim to add more advanced approaches that will allow executing the first _M_
tenants serially and the rest of the _N-M_ tenants in parallel.
