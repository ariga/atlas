:::info TL;DR

[GORM](https://gorm.io), a popular ORM for Go can easily query SQL views, but managing them has traditionally
been [an issue](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm/issues/4966). With the [latest release](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm/releases/tag/v0.4.0) of 
[Atlas GORM Provider](https://atlasgo.io/guides/orms/gorm), you can now easily manage views for your GORM application. 

[See an example](#demo-time)

## Introduction
 
> Making liberal use of views is a key aspect of good SQL database design.
>
> — <cite>**Postgres documentation**</cite>

Views are a powerful database feature: they are virtual table representing the result of a query. 
Many teams use them to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and present
 a consistent interface to users, abstracting the underlying data structures.

## The current landscape

Despite the benefits, views are often underutilized in many projects. Defining and managing database views can be tedious
 and error-prone, especially when it comes to migration. 

GORM is a fantastic ORM library that supports wide range of features 
and [migration](https://gorm.io/docs/migration.html#Auto-Migration) is one of them.

```go title="GORM documentation"
// AutoMigrate will create tables, missing foreign keys, constraints, columns and indexes.
db.AutoMigrate(&User{})

query := db.Model(&User{}).Where("age > ?", 20)

// Create View
db.Migrator().CreateView("users_pets", gorm.ViewOption{Query: query})
```
 
The migration does the job, but there are some limitations:

* Views are essentially virtual tables, but they are handled differently from tables in GORM.
* There is a knowledge gap when using the views for queries since they run through a migrator, not a physical model struct.
* Both tables and views are seamlessly created, but there is no way to keep track of the changes.

Therefore, if you need full control, consistent APIs, and want to 
adapt [versioned migrations](/concepts/declarative-vs-versioned#versioned-migrations) while still using
 your favorite GORM, Atlas is the answer.

## Introducing Atlas + GORM

Atlas can automatically plan database schema migrations for developers using GORM, 
with the help of the [GORM Atlas Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm). Moreover, not only tables but 
also views are now fully supported. With Atlas, views can be managed and versioned in the same way as tables, as they should be.

## Demo Time!

Let's walk through a step-by-step example of using GORM Atlas Provider
to automatically plan schema migrations for tables and views in a GORM project.

### Installation

If you haven't already, install Atlas from macOS or Linux by running:

```bash
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```

See [atlasgo.io](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) for more installation options.

In addition, the view feature is only available for logged-in users, run the following command to login:

```bash
atlas login
```

Install the provider by running:

```bash
go get -u ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm
```

#### Step 1: Create a GORM Application

Models are defined using normal structs. For views, we define a struct and 
implement the [ViewDefiner](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#ViewDefiner) interface. The `ViewDef(dialect string)` method receives the 
`dialect` argument to determine the SQL dialect to generate the view. It is helpful for generating the view definition for different SQL dialects if needed.

Let's create a file that will contain our database models. We will call it `models/models.go`

```go title="models/models.go"
package models

import (
  "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

// User is a regular gorm.Model stored in the "users" table.
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name   string
  Age    int
  Gender string
} 

// WorkingAgedUser is mapped to the VIEW definition below.
type WorkingAgedUser struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

For views, our provider provides two options for defining the view:
* [**BuildStmt**](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#BuildStmt): allows you to define a
 query using the GORM API. This is useful when you need to use GORM's query building capabilities.
* [**CreateStmt**](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#CreateStmt): allows you to define a
 query using raw SQL. This is useful when you need to define a complex query that GORM cannot handle.

##### BuildStmt

This option allows you to define the view using the GORM API. The dialect is handled automatically by GORM.

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
    return []gormschema.ViewOption{
        // view name will adhere to GORM's convention for table name
        // which is "working_aged_users" in this case
        gormschema.BuildStmt(func(db *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB {
            return db.Table("users").Select("name, age").Where("age BETWEEN 18 AND 60")
        }),
    }
}
```

##### CreateStmt

This option gives you more flexibility to define the view using raw SQL. However, it also involves a trade-off, as you 
need to handle the SQL dialects yourself if you want it to work across multiple databases (e.g. switching databases, writing integration tests, etc.).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Default dialect" label="Default dialect" default> 

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
  return []gormschema.ViewOption{
    gormschema.CreateStmt(`
      CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS 
      SELECT 
          name, 
          age 
      FROM 
          users 
      WHERE 
          age BETWEEN 18 AND 60
    `),
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Multiple dialects" label="Multiple dialects" default>

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
  var stmt string
  switch dialect {
  case "mysql":
    stmt = "CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 60"
  case "sqlserver":
    stmt = "CREATE VIEW [working_aged_users] ([name], [age]) AS SELECT [name], [age] FROM [users] WHERE [age] >= 18 AND [age] <= 60 WITH CHECK OPTION"
  }
  return []gormschema.ViewOption{
    gormschema.CreateStmt(stmt),
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For demonstration purposes, we will use the `CreateStmt` option with the default dialect.

#### Step 2: Setup Atlas GORM Provider

##### Standalone vs Go Program mode

This feature works in both **Standalone** and **Go Program** modes:
* **Standalone**: If your views and models are in the same package, you can use the provider directly to load your GORM schema into Atlas.
* **Go Program**: If you have them defined in different packages, you can use the provider as a library in your Go program to load your GORM schema into Atlas.

Since all of our models are in the same package, it's pretty handy to use 
the **Standalone** mode. But if you're curious, you can also try the **Go Program** mode with more detail in the [GORM Guide](https://atlasgo.io/guides/orms/gorm).

In your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
data "external_schema" "gorm" {
  program = [
    "go",
    "run",
    "-mod=mod",
    "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm",
    "load",
    "--path", "./models" // path to your models
    "--dialect", "mysql", // | postgres | sqlite | sqlserver
  ]
}

env "gorm" {
  src = data.external_schema.gorm.url
  dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev" // the dev-database needs to be mapped to the same dialect above
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Using docker://

If you use the `docker://` driver for spinning up your [Dev Database](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/dev-database) 
be sure that Docker is running locally on your machine first. 

:::

Next, to prevent the Go Modules system from dropping this dependency from our `go.mod` file, let's
follow the Go Module's [official recommendation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
for tracking dependencies of tools and add a file named `tools.go` with the following contents:

```go title="tools.go"
//go:build tools
package main

import _ "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema"
```

Alternatively, you can simply add a blank import to the `models.go` file we created above.

Finally, to tidy things up, run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

#### Step 3: Generate Migrations

We can now generate a migration file by running this command:

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env gorm 
```

Observe that files similar to this were created in the `migrations` directory:

```bash
migrations
├── 20240525153051.sql
└── atlas.sum

1 directory, 2 files
```

Examining the contents of `20240525153051.sql`:

```sql title="migrations/20240525153051.sql"
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `created_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `updated_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `deleted_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `name` longtext NULL,
  `age` bigint NULL,
  `gender` longtext NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  INDEX `idx_users_deleted_at` (`deleted_at`)
) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
-- Create "working_aged_users" view
CREATE VIEW `working_aged_users` (
  `name`,
  `age`
) AS select `users`.`name` AS `name`,`users`.`age` AS `age` from `users` where (`users`.`age` between 18 and 60);
```

Amazing! Atlas automatically generated a migration file that will create the `users` table and `working_aged_users` view in our database!

#### Step 4: Update the View

Next, as business requirements change, the age range is now different for each gender. Let's update the `WorkingAgedUser` struct and its view definition.

```diff title="models/models.go"
type WorkingAgedUser struct {
  Name   string
  Age    int
+ Gender string
}

func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
    return []gormschema.ViewOption{
        gormschema.CreateStmt(`
            CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS 
            SELECT 
                name, 
                age,
+               gender
            FROM 
                users 
            WHERE
-               age BETWEEN 18 AND 60             
+               (gender = 'male' AND age BETWEEN 18 AND 65) OR
+               (gender = 'female' AND age BETWEEN 18 AND 60)
        `),
    }
}
```

Re-run this command:

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env gorm 
```

Observe a new migration file is generated:

```bash
migrations
├── 20240525153051.sql
├── 20240525153152.sql
└── atlas.sum

1 directory, 3 files
```

```sql title="migrations/20240525153152.sql"
-- Modify "working_aged_users" view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `working_aged_users` (
  `name`,
  `age`,
  `gender`
) AS select `users`.`name` AS `name`,`users`.`age` AS `age`,`users`.`gender` AS `gender` from `users` where (((`users`.`gender` = 'male') and (`users`.`age` between 18 and 65)) or ((`users`.`gender` = 'female') and (`users`.`age` between 18 and 60)));
```
