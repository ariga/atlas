Today we announce the official preview support for CockroachDB ðŸŽ‰ [Give it a go](#how-to-use) and let us know what you think.

## Atlas
[Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) is an open source tool that helps developers manage their database schemas. It has a [CLI tool](https://atlasgo.io/cli/reference) and a [Terraform integration](https://atlasgo.io/blog/2022/05/04/announcing-terraform-provider). Lately, Atlas became the [migration Engine for Ent](https://entgo.io/blog/2022/01/20/announcing-new-migration-engine).

## CockroachDB
[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) NewSQL database. From their README:
> CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It scales horizontally; survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions; and provides a familiar SQL API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.  
  
CockroachDB has been gaining popularity and many of you [have](https://github.com/ent/ent/issues/2545) [been](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/785#issue-1231951038) [asking](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/issues/785#issuecomment-1125853135) us about it.

While CockroachDB aims to be PostgreSQL compatible, it still has some incompatibilities (e.g. [1](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/20296#issuecomment-1066140651),[2](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/82064),[3](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/81659)) which prevent the naive postgres dialect from working with it. Due to this, we had to work around these issues.  
  
With the latest release of Atlas, the postgres dialect automatically detects when it is connected to CockroachDB and uses a custom driver to handle the specific case.

# How to use
## Atlas CLI
Make sure you are using the latest version of Atlas, then connect to your CockroachDB as if it were a Postgres database, for example:
```bash
# to save the state of 'public' schema to `schema.hcl` run:
atlas schema inspect -u "postgres://root:pass@localhost:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=disable" -s "public" > schema.hcl
```
This should output an HCL file describing the schema of your CockroachDB. for example:
```hcl
table "users" {
  schema = schema.public
  column "id" {
    null = false
    type = bigint
    identity {
      generated = BY_DEFAULT
    }
  }
  column "age" {
    null = true
    type = bigint
  }
  column "name" {
    null = true
    type = text
  }
  primary_key {
    columns = [column.id]
  }
}
schema "public" {
}
```

# Preview support
The integration of Atlas with CockroachDB is well tested with version `v21.2.11` (at the time of writing, `latest`) and will be extended in the future.
