Hi everyone,

It's been about a month since our last release, and we're excited to announce that
[Atlas v0.26](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/releases/tag/v0.25.0) is now available!
In this release we are happy to introduce a new feature that has been requested by many of you: **support for Entity
Framework Core**.  As part of our ever going effort to improve the quality and coverage of our documentation, we have
published a set of guides on testing database schemas and migrations as well as a new GORM Portal.

Additionally, we have published an official "Supported Version Policy" and made some changes to our EULA, described below.

### What's missing in EF Core Migrations?

EF Core is the most popular ORM used in the .NET community, supported by **Microsoft**. EF Core allows
users to manage their database schemas using its [migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/).
EF Core's migrations have long been a popular and reliable choice for managing database schema changes in the C# ecosystem.

However, EF Core migrations have lacks some capabilities can make them difficult to work with:

1. **Support for advanced database features.** Like many ORMs, EF Core is designed to be database-agnostic, which means
it does not support all the features of every database it can connect to. This can make it difficult to use and manage
database features such as triggers, stored procedures, Row-level security and custom data types.
2. **Testing migrations.** Migrations are typically considered the most risky part of a deployment. Therefore, automatically
verifying they are [safe](/versioned/lint) and [correct](/testing/migrate) is paramount.  Like most ORMs, EF Core does not
provide a way to automatically test migrations.
3. **Production Grade Declarative Flow.** EF Core supports a very basic declarative flow name
[`EnsureCreated`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/ensure-created#ensurecreated)
that can be used to create the database without specifying migrations. However, as the documentation
[warns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/ensure-created#ensurecreated), this method should
not be used in production. For teams that want to adapt a "Terraform-for-databases" approach, this can be a blocker.
4. **Integration with modern CI/CD pipelines.** EF Core migrations are typically run using the `dotnet ef` command line tool.
Migrations should be integrated into the software delivery pipeline to ensure that the database schema is always in sync
with the application code. This can be difficult to achieve with EF Core migrations.

## Atlas and EF Core Migrations

[Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) is a database schema as code tool that allows developers to inspect, plan, test, and execute
schema changes to their database. Atlas can be used to replace EF Core migrations with a more modern DevOps approach.

Comparing Atlas to EF Core migrations:
* **Loading Core Models.** Similarly to EF Core migrations, Atlas can load the schema of an EF Core project. EF Core users
can keep using the EF Core models as the source of truth for their database schema. Using the
[Atlas EF Core Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-ef), Atlas can load the schema of an EF Core project
and use it as the source of truth for the database schema.

* **Composing schemas.** Atlas can compose schemas from multiple sources, including EF Core models, SQL files, and
external schema datasources. This enables users to natively declare schemas that layer advanced database features
(such as views, triggers) as part of the schema source of truth which is not possible with EF Core.

* **Automatic planning.** Similarly to EF Core migrations, with its "versioned migrations" workflow, Atlas can
automatically plan schema migrations by diffing the data model with the migration directory.

* **Declarative flow.** Atlas supports a declarative flow that can be used to create the database schema from scratch
without using migrations. This is useful for teams that want to adapt a "Terraform-for-databases" approach.

* **Testing migrations.** Atlas can automatically lint and test migrations to ensure they are safe and correct. Using
this capability teams can reduce the risk of deploying migrations to production.

* **Integration with CI/CD pipelines.** Atlas can be integrated into modern CI/CD pipelines using native integrations
with popular CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Terraform, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and more.

### Getting Started with Atlas + EF Core

As part of this version, we are happy to release the [Atlas EF Core Provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-ef).

To get started with Atlas and EF Core, head over to the [Official Guide](/guides/orms/efcore).

## New GORM Portal

Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in the number of users using [GORM](https://gorm.io) with Atlas.
To better support GORM users in the Atlas ecosystem, we have launched a new documentation portal that provides
guides, tutorials, and examples for using GORM with Atlas.

You can find the new GORM portal [here](/guides/orms/gorm).

## Testing Database Schemas and Migrations

Since starting Atlas, it has been [Ariel](https://github.com/a8m) and my belief that accurate and thorough documentation
is essential for the success of any software project targeted at developers. To that end, our team has been working hard
to improve the quality and coverage of our documentation covering one of the most important aspects of working with
Database Schema-as-Code: **Testing**.

As part of this set of guides you can find:

* [Testing Data Migrations](/guides/testing/data-migrations)
* [Testing SQL Views](/guides/testing/views)
* [Testing SQL Functions](/guides/testing/functions)
* [Testing Postgres Domains](/guides/testing/domains)
* [Testing SQL Procedures](/guides/testing/procedures)
* [Testing SQL Triggers](/guides/testing/triggers)

## Supported Version Policy

To ensure the best performance, security and compatibility, the Atlas team will only
support the three most recent minor versions of the CLI. For example, if the latest version is v0.26, the supported versions
will be v0.25 and v0.24 (in addition to any patch releases and the "canary" release which is built twice a day).

As part of our this policy, binaries for versions that were published more than 6 months ago will be removed from the
CDN and Docker Hub.

## EULA Changes

The standard Atlas binary is provided under the Atlas EULA. We have recently made some changes to the EULA to reflect
new data privacy considerations described in our [CLI Data Privacy](/cli/data-privacy) document.  As part of these changes
Atlas may collect anonymous telemetry (aggregated, anonymized, non-personal) data to help us improve the product.
If you wish to opt-out of telemetry, you may set the `ATLAS_NO_ANON_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `true`.

The updated EULA can be found [here](https://ariga.io/legal/atlas/eula).

## Wrapping Up

That's all for this release! We hope you try out (and enjoy) all of these new features and find them useful.
Stay tuned for our next release which is going to include some exciting new features around declarative flows
and database schema observability.
