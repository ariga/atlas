### Learning new things 

There are many ways to learn about a new topic. You can read books, watch videos, or even take a course. But one of the
most effective ways to learn is by doing. This is especially true when it comes to learning about a new tool or
technology. In order to truly understand how a tool works, you need to use it and see how it behaves in different
situations.

This is why I'm excited to announce that we've partnered with [Wilco](https://trywilco.com/) to create a new
kind of learning experience for Atlas users. Wilco develops a platform, built to emulate the conditions at a tech
startup, sends users on "quests" that cover everyday engineering tasks - from deploying an app to finding the root cause
of a production issue - utilizing real-life tech stacks.

When I first heard about Wilco, I was immediately intrigued by the idea of using a simulation game to
teach people about database migrations and especially about solving all kinds of issues that many engineers
only hit during a serious outage when there's very little room for error.

### Introducing Wilco

When you use Wilco, you're put in the shoes of a software engineer at a fictional startup. You're given access
to a made up chat system humoristically called "Snack" where you meet different characters that you can interact with.
You're also given access to a real GitHub repo and the means to run a real development environment on your local
machine.

### The new Atlas quest on Wilco

In the first quest we're releasing today on Wilco, you will be tasked with planning a seemingly simple database
migration to support the development of a new feature in your imaginary company's app. As your team starts to
roll out the feature, you will quickly realize that there are some serious issues that must be resolved, and fast!

And now, without further ado, you can head over to [start your quest](https://app.wilco.gg/catalog/quest/atlas-data-dependent-changes)!
