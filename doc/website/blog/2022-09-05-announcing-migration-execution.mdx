With the release of [v0.6.0](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/releases/tag/v0.6.0), we
[introduced](https://atlasgo.io/blog/2022/08/11/announcing-versioned-migration-authoring) a workflow for managing
changes to database schemas that we have called: _Versioned Migration Authoring_.

Today, we released the first version of the Atlas migration execution engine, that can apply migration files on
your database. In this post, we will give a brief overview of the features and what to expect in the future.

### Migration File Format

The Atlas migration filename format follows a very simple structure: `version_[name].sql`, with the `name` being
optional. `version` can be an arbitrary string. Migration files are lexicographically sorted by filename.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="tree"
    values={[
        {label: 'Tree', value: 'tree'},
        {label: '1_initial.sql', value: '1'},
        {label: '2_second.sql', value: '2'},
        {label: '3_second.sql', value: '3'},
        {label: 'atlas.sum', value: 'sum'},
]}>
<TabItem value="tree">

```shell
↪ tree .
.
├── 1_initial.sql
├── 2_second.sql
├── 3_third.sql
└── atlas.sum

0 directories, 4 files
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="1">

```sql
-- add new schema named "my_schema"
CREATE DATABASE `my_schema`;
-- create "tbl" table
CREATE TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl` (`col` int NOT NULL);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2">

```sql
ALTER TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl` ADD `col_2` TEXT;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3">

```sql
CREATE TABLE `tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sum">

```text
h1:cD9kOv5VDRLrKVZ0pM4CxAlhH6mgE8PQLpUeuIMKDcs=

2_second.sql h1:FPzwV+MzwyCss7SASZtyafXiYc9Un5bzlcc3u7MxLJU=
3_third.sql h1:uD+xDcA3Q+gHqwca2ZBDAHWYvC2eiUcwr1IgMsN0Q6c=

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you want to follow along, you can simply copy and paste the above files in a folder on your system. Make sure you
have a database ready to work on. You can start an ephemeral docker container with the following command:

```shell
# Run a local mysql container listening on port 3306.
docker run --rm --name atlas-apply --detach --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass -p 3306:3306 mysql:8
```

### Apply Migrations

In order to apply migrations you need to have the Atlas CLI in version v0.7.0 or above. Follow the
[installation instructions](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) if you don't have Atlas installed yet.

Now, to apply the first migration of our migration directory, we call `atlas migrate apply` and pass in some
configuration parameters.

```shell
atlas migrate apply 1 \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
Migrating to version 1 (1 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 1
    -> CREATE DATABASE `my_schema`;
    -> CREATE TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl` (`col` int NOT NULL);
  -- ok (17.247319ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 18.784204ms
  -- 1 migrations
  -- 2 sql statements

```

### Migration Status

Atlas saves information about the database schema revisions (applied migration versions) in a special table called
`atlas_schema_revisions`. In the example above we connected to the database without specifying which schema to operate
against. For this reason, Atlas created the revision table in a new schema called `atlas_schema_revisions`. For a
schema-bound connection Atlas will put the table into the connected schema. We will see that in a bit.

Go ahead and call `atlas migrate status` to gather information about the database migration state:

```shell
atlas migrate status \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
Migration Status: PENDING
  -- Current Version:  1
  -- Next Version:     2
  -- Executed Files:   1
  -- Pending Files:    2

```

This output tells us that the last applied version is `1`, the next one is called `2` and that we still have two
migrations pending. Let's apply the pending migrations:

Note, that we do not pass an argument to the `apply`, in which case Atlas will attempt to apply all pending migrations.

```shell
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
Migrating to version 3 from 1 (2 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 2
    -> ALTER TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl` ADD `col_2` TEXT;
  -- ok (13.98847ms)

  -- migrating version 3
    -> CREATE TABLE `tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL);
     Error 1046: No database selected

  -------------------------
  -- 15.604338ms
  -- 1 migrations ok (1 with errors)
  -- 1 sql statements ok (1 with errors)

Error: Execution had errors:
Error 1046: No database selected

Error: sql/migrate: executing statement "CREATE TABLE `tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL);" from version "3": Error 1046: No database selected
exit status 1

```

What happened here? After further investigation, you will find that our connection URL is bound to the entire database,
not to a schema. The third migration file however does not contain a schema qualifier for the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

By default, Atlas wraps the execution of each migration file into one transaction. This transaction gets rolled back
if any error occurs withing execution. Be aware though, that some databases, such as MySQL and MariaDB, don't support
transactional DDL. If you want to learn how to configure the way Atlas uses transactions, have a look at the
[docs](/versioned/apply#transaction-configuration).

### Migration Retry

To resolve this edit the migration file and add a qualifier to the statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL);
```

Since you changed the contents of a migration file, we have to re-calculate the directory integrity hash-sum by calling:

```shell
atlas migrate hash --force \
  --dir "file://migrations"
```

Then we can proceed and simply attempt to execute the migration file again.

```shell
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
Migrating to version 3 from 2 (1 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 3
    -> CREATE TABLE `my_schema`.`tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL);
  -- ok (15.168892ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 16.741173ms
  -- 1 migrations
  -- 1 sql statements

```

Attempting to migrate again or calling `atlas migrate status` will tell us that all migrations have been applied onto
the database and there is nothing to do at the moment.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="apply"
    values={[
        {label: 'atlas migrate apply', value: 'apply'},
        {label: 'atlas migrate status', value: 'status'},
]}>
<TabItem value="apply">

```shell
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
No migration files to execute
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="status">

```shell
atlas migrate status \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/"
```

```shell
Migration Status: OK
  -- Current Version:  3
  -- Next Version:     Already at latest version
  -- Executed Files:   3
  -- Pending Files:    0

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Moving an existing project to Atlas with Baseline Migrations

Another common scenario is when you need to move an existing project to Atlas. To do so, create an initial migration
file reflecting the current state of a database schema by using `atlas migrate diff`. A very simple way to do so would
be by heading over to the database from before, deleting the `atlas_schema_revisions` schema, emptying your migration
directory and running the `atlas migrate diff` command.

```shell
rm -rf migrations
docker exec atlas-apply mysql -ppass -e "CREATE SCHEMA `my_schema_dev`;" # create a dev-db
docker exec atlas-apply mysql -ppass -e "DROP SCHEMA `atlas_schema_revisions`;"
atlas migrate diff \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --to "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/my_schema" \
  --dev-url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/my_schema_dev"
```

To demonstrate that Atlas can also work on a schema level instead of a realm connection, we are running on a connection
bound to the `my_schema` schema this time.

You should end up with the following migration directory:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="file"
    values={[
        {label: '20220908105652.sql', value: 'file'},
        {label: 'atlas.sum', value: 'sum'},
]}>
<TabItem value="file">

```sql
-- create "tbl" table
CREATE TABLE `tbl` (`col` int NOT NULL, `col_2` text NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
-- create "tbl_2" table
CREATE TABLE `tbl_2` (`col` int NOT NULL) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sum">

```text
h1:5zAQ8J0qziTKWg09fRNdbUf3rnLdvA1KHayh8l1SgM0=
20220908105652.sql h1:4WEB39tqALVYNQJTfULKizxEuUC37sgFs0LN5dKJpOw=

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Now, let's create a new migration file to create a table `tbl_3` and update the directory integrity file.

```shell
atlas migrate new add_table --dir "file://migrations"
echo "CREATE TABLE `tbl_3` (`col` text NULL);" >> migrations/$(ls -t migrations | head -n1)
atlas migrate hash --force --dir "file://migrations"
```

Since we now have both a migration file representing our current database state and the new migration file to apply,
we can make use of the `--baseline` flag:

```shell
atlas migrate apply \
  --dir "file://migrations" \
  --url "mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/my_schema" \
  --baseline "20220908110527" # replace the version with the one generated by you
```

```shell
Migrating to version 20220908110847 from 20220908110527 (1 migrations in total):

  -- migrating version 20220908110847
    -> CREATE TABLE `tbl_3` (`col` text NULL);
  -- ok (14.325493ms)

  -------------------------
  -- 15.786455ms
  -- 1 migrations
  -- 1 sql statements
```

### Outlook

The Atlas migration engine is powering [Ent](https://entgo.io) and the execution engine is already being used within
Ariga for several months. We will continue working on improving it, releasing cool features, such as assisted
troubleshooting for failed migrations, a more intelligent, dialect-aware execution planning for things like MySQLs
implicits commits and more.

### Wrapping up

In this post we learned about the new migration execution engine of Atlas and some information about its internals.
