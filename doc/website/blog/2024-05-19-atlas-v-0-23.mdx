Hi everyone,

It's been a few weeks since the release of [v0.22](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/releases/tag/v0.22.0), and we're
excited to be back with the next version of Atlas, with some long awaited features and improvements.

* [Redshift](#redshift-support) Support - [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), a fully managed, petabyte-scale data
  warehouse service in the cloud.  Starting today, you can use Atlas to manage your Redshift Schema-as-Code.
* [CircleCI Integration](#circleci-integration) - Following some recent requests from our Enterprise customers, we have
  added a CircleCI orb to make it easier to integrate Atlas into your CI/CD pipeline.
* [ERD v2](#erd-v2) - One of the most common use-cases for Atlas Cloud today is to generate ERDs to easily visualize your schema.
  We have made some improvements to the ERD generation process to make it even better.

Let's dive in!

### Redshift Beta Support

Atlas's "Database Schema-as-Code" is useful even for managing small schemas with a few tables, but it really shines when
you have a large schema with many tables, views, and other objects.  This is the common case instead of the exception
when you are dealing with Data Warehouses like Redshift that aggregate data from multiple sources.

Data warehouses typically store complex and diverse datasets consisting of hundreds of tables with thousands of columns
and relationships.  Managing these schemas manually can be a nightmare, and that's where Atlas comes in.

Today we are happy to announce the beta support for Amazon Redshift in Atlas.  You can now use Atlas to manage your
Redshift schema, generate ERDs, plan and apply changes, and more.

To get started, first install the latest version of the Atlas CLI:

<InstallationInstructions/>

Next, login to your Atlas account to activate the Redshift beta feature:

```bash
atlas login
```

To verify Atlas is able to connect to your Redshift database, run the following command:

```bash
atlas schema inspect --url "redshift://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?search_path=<schema>"
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see the [Atlas DDL](/atlas-schema/hcl) representation of your Redshift schema.

To learn more about the Redshift support in Atlas, check out the [documentation](/docs/redshift).

### CircleCI Integration

CircleCI is a popular CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your software development process.  With this version
we have added a [CircleCI orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/ariga/atlas-orb) to make it easier to integrate
Atlas into your CircleCI pipeline.  [CircleCI orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/) are reusable packages of
YAML configuration that condense repeated pieces of config into a single line of code.

As an example, suppose you wanted to create a CircleCI pipeline that pushes your migration directory to your Atlas Cloud
Schema Registry.  You can use the `atlas-orb` to simplify the configuration:

```yaml
version: '2.1'
orbs:
  atlas-orb: ariga/atlas-orb@0.0.3
workflows:
  postgres-example:
    jobs:
      - push-dir:
          context: the-context-has-ATLAS_TOKEN
          docker:
            - image: cimg/base:current
            - environment:
                POSTGRES_DB: postgres
                POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
                POSTGRES_USER: postgres
              image: cimg/postgres:16.2
          steps:
            - checkout
            - atlas-orb/setup:
                cloud_token_env: ATLAS_TOKEN
                version: latest
            - atlas-orb/migrate_push:
                dev_url: >-
                  postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
                dir_name: my-cool-project
```

Let's break down the configuration:
* The `push-dir` job uses the `cimg/postgres:16.2` Docker image to run a PostgreSQL database.
  This database will be used as the [Dev Database](/concepts/dev-database) for different operations
  performed by Atlas.
* The `atlas-orb/setup` step initializes the Atlas CLI with the provided `ATLAS_TOKEN` environment variable.
* The `atlas-orb/migrate_push` step pushes the migration directory `my-cool-project` to the Atlas Cloud Schema Registry.

### ERD v2

One of the most common use-cases for Atlas Cloud today is to generate ERDs to easily visualize your schema.  We have made
some improvements to the ERD generation process to make it even better.
