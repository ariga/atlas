:::info TL;DR

[GORM](https://gorm.io), a popular ORM for Go can easily query SQL views, but managing them has traditionally
been [an issue](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm/issues/4966). With the [latest release](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm/releases/tag/v0.4.0) of 
[Atlas GORM Provider](https://atlasgo.io/guides/orms/gorm), you can now easily manage views for your GORM application. 

[See an example](#demo-time)

Views are a powerful database feature: they are virtual table representing the result of a query. 
Many teams use them to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and present
a consistent interface to users, abstracting the underlying data structures.

## Using Views with ORMs

Despite their numerous benefits, views are often underutilized in many applications. Specifically,
many ORMs provide partial support for views.

This is also the case with GORM, one of the most popular ORMs in Go. Let's see how GORM users can
integrate views into their applications today: 

First, we need to define the query that will back our view, and then use 
the GORM [Migrator](https://pkg.go.dev/gorm.io/gorm/migrator#Migrator) interface to create the view:

```go
query := db.Model(&User{}).Select("id, name, age").Where("age BETWEEN 18 AND 60")

db.Migrator().CreateView("working_aged_users", gorm.ViewOption{Query: query})
// CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS SELECT id, name, age FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 60
```

In order to be able to use GORM to query our view, we need to define an _additional_ struct:

```go
type WorkingAgedUser struct {
  ID     uint
  Name   string
  Age    int
}
```

Finally, we can use GORM to query records from our view:

```go
var johnFamilies []WorkingAgedUser
db.Where("name LIKE ?", "John%").Find(&johnFamilies)
// SELECT * FROM `working_aged_users` WHERE name LIKE "John%"
```

Notice that this works by convention, GORM uses reflection and transforms the struct type name `WorkingAgedUser` to `working_aged_users`.

I have always felt that working with views in GORM isn't the smoothest experience. Here's why:

The "GORM way" of doing things is defining struct types and using them for everything. They serve as the foundation 
for modeling, querying data, and migrations. However, in my eyes, the current way of using views in GORM doesn't align with this principle.
Views are defined in multiple places: the backing query, the migration step, and finally the runtime query struct.

As a GORM user, I have always wished that everything would just work from the same struct definition.
 
To address this challenge, our team working on the [Atlas GORM provider](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-provider-gorm) (an Atlas plugin that enhances GORM's migration 
and capabilities) came up with a neat solution. Here's what it looks like:

```go title="models/models.go"
// WorkingAgedUsers is mapped to the VIEW definition below.
type WorkingAgedUsers struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}

func (WorkingAgedUsers) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
  return []gormschema.ViewOption{
    gormschema.BuildStmt(func(db *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB {
      return db.Model(&User{}).Where("age BETWEEN 18 AND 60").Select("id, name, age")
    }),
  }
}
```

The migration step is now as simple as:

```go title="main.go"
gormschema.New("mysql").Load(
  &models.User{},			    // Table-based model.
  &models.WorkingAgedUsers{},	// View-based model.
)
```

It is also worth mentioning that querying the view is still the same:

```go
var johnFamilies []WorkingAgedUser
db.Where("name LIKE ?", "John%").Find(&johnFamilies)
// SELECT * FROM `working_aged_users` WHERE name LIKE "John%"
```

The key benefits of this approach are:
 
* **Alignment with GORM Philosophy**: It follows the GORM (and generally ORM) principle that
 structs model database objects, both for schema definition and querying.
* **Unified Source of Truth**: It consolidates the schema source of truth for migrations and the 
DB Query API in a single location - the view definition structs.

This seamless integration of views with GORM's core principles results in a more organic and 
holistic workflow when working with database views. In the end, it's easy to 
think of views as read-only tables backed by a query, and this is precisely what this API is designed for.

## Demo Time!

Let's walk through a step-by-step example of using GORM Atlas Provider
to automatically plan schema migrations for tables and views in a GORM project.

### Installation

If you haven't already, install Atlas from macOS or Linux by running:

```bash
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```

See [atlasgo.io](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) for more installation options.

In addition, the view feature is only available for logged-in users, run the following command to login:

```bash
atlas login
```

Install the provider by running:

```bash
go get -u ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm
```

#### Step 1: Create a GORM Application

Models are defined using normal structs. For views, we define a struct and 
implement the [ViewDefiner](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#ViewDefiner) interface. The `ViewDef(dialect string)` method receives the 
`dialect` argument to determine the SQL dialect to generate the view. It is helpful for generating the view definition for different SQL dialects if needed.

Let's create a file that will contain our database models. We will call it `models/models.go`

```go title="models/models.go"
package models

import (
  "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

// User is a regular gorm.Model stored in the "users" table.
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name   string
  Age    int
  Gender string
} 

// WorkingAgedUser is mapped to the VIEW definition below.
type WorkingAgedUser struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

For views, our provider provides two options for defining the view:
* [**BuildStmt**](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#BuildStmt): allows you to define a
 query using the GORM API. This is useful when you need to use GORM's query building capabilities.
* [**CreateStmt**](https://pkg.go.dev/ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema#CreateStmt): allows you to define a
 query using raw SQL. This is useful when you need to define a complex query that GORM cannot handle.

##### BuildStmt

This option allows you to define the view using the GORM API. The dialect is handled automatically by GORM.

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
    return []gormschema.ViewOption{
        // view name will adhere to GORM's convention for table name
        // which is "working_aged_users" in this case
        gormschema.BuildStmt(func(db *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB {
            return db.Table("users").Select("name, age").Where("age BETWEEN 18 AND 60")
        }),
    }
}
```

##### CreateStmt

This option gives you more flexibility to define the view using raw SQL. However, it also involves a trade-off, as you 
need to handle the SQL dialects yourself if you want it to work across multiple databases (e.g. switching databases, writing integration tests, etc.).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Default dialect" label="Default dialect" default> 

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
  return []gormschema.ViewOption{
    gormschema.CreateStmt(`
      CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS 
      SELECT 
          name, 
          age 
      FROM 
          users 
      WHERE 
          age BETWEEN 18 AND 60
    `),
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Multiple dialects" label="Multiple dialects" default>

```go title="models/models.go"
func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
  var stmt string
  switch dialect {
  case "mysql":
    stmt = "CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 60"
  case "sqlserver":
    stmt = "CREATE VIEW [working_aged_users] ([name], [age]) AS SELECT [name], [age] FROM [users] WHERE [age] >= 18 AND [age] <= 60 WITH CHECK OPTION"
  }
  return []gormschema.ViewOption{
    gormschema.CreateStmt(stmt),
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For demonstration purposes, we will use the `CreateStmt` option with the default dialect.

#### Step 2: Setup Atlas GORM Provider

##### Standalone vs Go Program mode

This feature works in both **Standalone** and **Go Program** modes:
* **Standalone**: If your views and models are in the same package, you can use the provider directly to load your GORM schema into Atlas.
* **Go Program**: If you have them defined in different packages, you can use the provider as a library in your Go program to load your GORM schema into Atlas.

Since all of our models are in the same package, it's pretty handy to use 
the **Standalone** mode. But if you're curious, you can also try the **Go Program** mode with more detail in the [GORM Guide](https://atlasgo.io/guides/orms/gorm).

In your project directory, create a new file named `atlas.hcl` with the following contents:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
data "external_schema" "gorm" {
  program = [
    "go",
    "run",
    "-mod=mod",
    "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm",
    "load",
    "--path", "./models" // path to your models
    "--dialect", "mysql", // | postgres | sqlite | sqlserver
  ]
}

env "gorm" {
  src = data.external_schema.gorm.url
  dev = "docker://mysql/8/dev" // the dev-database needs to be mapped to the same dialect above
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations"
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Using docker://

If you use the `docker://` driver for spinning up your [Dev Database](https://atlasgo.io/concepts/dev-database) 
be sure that Docker is running locally on your machine first. 

:::

Next, to prevent the Go Modules system from dropping this dependency from our `go.mod` file, let's
follow the Go Module's [official recommendation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)
for tracking dependencies of tools and add a file named `tools.go` with the following contents:

```go title="tools.go"
//go:build tools
package main

import _ "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm/gormschema"
```

Alternatively, you can simply add a blank import to the `models.go` file we created above.

Finally, to tidy things up, run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

#### Step 3: Generate Migrations

We can now generate a migration file by running this command:

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env gorm 
```

Observe that files similar to this were created in the `migrations` directory:

```bash
migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ 20240525153051.sql
â””â”€â”€ atlas.sum

1 directory, 2 files
```

Examining the contents of `20240525153051.sql`:

```sql title="migrations/20240525153051.sql"
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `created_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `updated_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `deleted_at` datetime(3) NULL,
  `name` longtext NULL,
  `age` bigint NULL,
  `gender` longtext NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  INDEX `idx_users_deleted_at` (`deleted_at`)
) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
-- Create "working_aged_users" view
CREATE VIEW `working_aged_users` (
  `name`,
  `age`
) AS select `users`.`name` AS `name`,`users`.`age` AS `age` from `users` where (`users`.`age` between 18 and 60);
```

Amazing! Atlas automatically generated a migration file that will create the `users` table and `working_aged_users` view in our database!

#### Step 4: Update the View

Next, as business requirements change, the age range is now different for each gender. Let's update the `WorkingAgedUser` struct and its view definition.

```diff title="models/models.go"
type WorkingAgedUser struct {
  Name   string
  Age    int
+ Gender string
}

func (WorkingAgedUser) ViewDef(dialect string) []gormschema.ViewOption {
    return []gormschema.ViewOption{
        gormschema.CreateStmt(`
            CREATE VIEW working_aged_users AS 
            SELECT 
                name, 
                age,
+               gender
            FROM 
                users 
            WHERE
-               age BETWEEN 18 AND 60             
+               (gender = 'male' AND age BETWEEN 18 AND 65) OR
+               (gender = 'female' AND age BETWEEN 18 AND 60)
        `),
    }
}
```

Re-run this command:

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env gorm 
```

Observe a new migration file is generated ðŸŽ‰:

```bash
migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ 20240525153051.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ 20240525153152.sql
â””â”€â”€ atlas.sum

1 directory, 3 files
```

```sql title="migrations/20240525153152.sql"
-- Modify "working_aged_users" view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `working_aged_users` (
  `name`,
  `age`,
  `gender`
) AS select `users`.`name` AS `name`,`users`.`age` AS `age`,`users`.`gender` AS `gender` from `users` where (((`users`.`gender` = 'male') and (`users`.`age` between 18 and 65)) or ((`users`.`gender` = 'female') and (`users`.`age` between 18 and 60)));
```
