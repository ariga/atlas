## Introduction

This document serves as reference documentation for all available commands in the Atlas CLI.
Similar information can be obtained by running any atlas command with the `-h` or `--help`
flags.

For a more detailed introduction to the CLI capabilities, head over to the
[Getting Started](/getting-started/) page.

## Distributed Binaries

The binaries and Docker images distributed in official releases are released in two flavors:

* Atlas - A binary built from the OSS repository in addition to proprietary code maintained by
  [Ariga](https://ariga.io), including access to the Atlas Cloud service and commercial driver support.
  Atlas is distributed under the [Atlas EULA](https://ariga.io/legal/atlas/eula).
* Atlas Community - A binary built from the OSS repository only. Atlas Community is distributed under
  the [Apache 2 License](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/blob/master/LICENSE).

For instructions on how to install Atlas Community, see this [guide](/community-edition).
