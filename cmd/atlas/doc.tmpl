## Introduction

This document serves as reference documentation for all available commands in the Atlas CLI.
Similar information can be obtained by running any atlas command with the `-h` or `--help`
flags.

For a more detailed introduction to the CLI capabilities, head over to the
[Getting Started](/getting-started/) page.

## Supported Version Policy

To ensure the best performance, security and compatibility with the Atlas Cloud service, the Atlas team
will only support the two most recent minor versions of the CLI. For example, if the latest version is
`v0.25`, the supported versions will be `v0.24` and `v0.25` (in addition to any patch releases and the
"canary" release which is built twice a day).

## Distributed Binaries

:::info Old Versions

As part of our **Supported Version Policy** mentioned above, binaries for versions that were published
more than 6 months ago will be removed from the CDN and Docker Hub.

:::

The binaries and Docker images distributed in official releases are released in two flavors:

* Atlas - A binary built from the OSS repository in addition to proprietary code maintained by
  [Ariga](https://ariga.io), including access to the Atlas Cloud service and commercial driver support.
  Atlas is distributed under the [Atlas EULA](https://ariga.io/legal/atlas/eula).
* Atlas Community - A binary built from the OSS repository only. Atlas Community is distributed under
  the [Apache 2 License](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/blob/master/LICENSE).

For instructions on how to install Atlas Community, see this [guide](/community-edition).
